576, i must not confuse them with experience which willhave to rest on my own observation or my memory of them ,Dracula,False
577,last even when the count came from hi room he began byask me question on legal matter and on the do ofcertain kind of busin ,Dracula,False
578, i had spent the day wearily overbook and simply to keep my mind occupied went over someof the matter i had been examined in at lincoln' inn ,Dracula,False

587, now suppose i who have much of affair wish to ship good say to new castle or durham or harwich or dover might it not be thatit could with more ease be done by consign to one inthese ports ,Dracula,False
588,  i answered that certainly it would be most easy butthat we solicitor had a system of agency one for the other so that local work could be done locally on instruction fromany solicitor so that the client simply plac himselfin the hand of one man could have hi wishe carried outby him without further trouble ,Dracula,False
589,  but said he i could be at liberty to direct myself ,Dracula,False
590,  of course i replied and such i often done by menof busin who do not like the whole of their affair to beknown by any one person ,Dracula,False
591, he said and then went on to ask about the meansof mak consignment and the form to be gone through andof all sort of difficultie which might arise but by fore thought could be guarded against ,Dracula,False
592, i explained all theseth to him to the best of my ability and he certainlyleft me under the impression that he would have made awonderful solicitor for there wa noth that he did notthink of or foresee ,Dracula,False
593, for a man who wa never in the country and who did not evidently do much in the way of busin hisknowledge and acumen were wonderful ,Dracula,False

608, so i determined to write only formal note now butto write fully to hawkin in secret and also to mina for to her i could write shorthand which would puzzle thecount if he did see it ,Dracula,False
609, when i had written my two letter isat quiet read a book whilst the count wrote severalnote referr a he wrote them to some book on hi table ,Dracula,False

4261, they were smaller and the edgeslooked fresher that wa all ,Dracula,False
4262, we asked vincent to what heattributed them and he replied that it must have been abite of some animal perhap a rat but for hi own part hewa inclined to think it wa one of the bat which are sonumerou on the northern height of london ,Dracula,False
4263, out of so manyharml one he said there may be some wild specimenfrom the south of a more malignant specie ,Dracula,False
4264, some sailor mayhave brought one home and it managed to escape or even fromthe zoological garden a young one may have got loose or onebe bred there from a vampire ,Dracula,False
4265, these th do occur you know ,Dracula,False
4266, only ten day ago a wolf got out and wa i believe traced up in thi direction ,Dracula,False

4269, when she asked him whyhe wanted to go he said he wanted to play with the `blooferlady' ,Dracula,False
4270,  i hope said van hels that when you are sendingthe child home you will caution it parent to keep strictwatch over it ,Dracula,False
4271, these fancie to stray are most dangerou and if the child were to remain out another night it wouldprobably be fatal ,Dracula,False

4273,  certainly not not for a week at least longer if thewound i not healed ,Dracula,False
4274,  our visit to the hospital took more time than we hadreckoned on and the sun had dipped before we came out ,Dracula,False

4282, a we went further we met fewer and fewer people till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even thepatrol of horse police go their usual suburban round ,Dracula,False

4284, with some little difficulty for it wa very dark andthe whole place seemed so strange to u we found the west enra tomb ,Dracula,False
4285, the professor took the key opened the creakydoor and stand back politely but quite unconsciously motioned me to precede him ,Dracula,False
4286, there wa a deliciou irony inthe offer in the courtlin of giv preference on such aghastly occasion ,Dracula,False
4287, my companion followed me quickly andcautiously drew the door to after carefully ascertainingthat the lock wa a fall and not a spr one ,Dracula,False
4288, in thelatter case we should have been in a bad plight ,Dracula,False

4290, the tomb in the daytime and when wreathed with fresh flower had looked grim andgruesome enough but now some day afterward when theflower hung lank and dead their white turn to rust andtheir green to brown when the spider and the beetle hadresumed their accustomed dominance when the time discoloredstone and dust encrusted mortar and rusty dank iron andtarnished bras and clouded silver plat gave back thefeeble glimmer of a candle the effect wa more miserableand sordid than could have been imagined ,Dracula,False
4291, it conveyed irr esistibly the idea that life animal life wa not the onlyth which could pas away ,Dracula,False
4292,  van hels went about hi work systematically ,Dracula,False
4293, hold hi candle so that he could read the coffin plate andso hold it that the sperm dropped in white patche whichcongealed a they touched the metal he made assurance oflucy' coffin ,Dracula,False

4299, thesight wa almost too much for me ,Dracula,False
4300, it seemed to be a much anaffront to the dead a it would have been to have strippedoff her cloth in her sleep whilst liv ,Dracula,False
4301, i actually tookhold of hi hand to stop him ,Dracula,False
4302,  he only said you shall see and again fumbl in hisbag took out a tiny fret saw ,Dracula,False
4303, strik the turnscrew throughthe lead with a swift downward stab which made me wince hemade a small hole which wa however big enough to admitthe point of the saw ,Dracula,False
4304, i had expected a rush of ga from theweek old corpse ,Dracula,False
4305, we doctor who have had to study our dan ger have to become accustomed to such th and i drewback toward the door ,Dracula,False
4306, but the professor never stopped fora moment ,Dracula,False

4318, some of theundertaker' people may have stolen it ,Dracula,False
4319, i felt that i wasspeak folly and yet it wa the only real cause which icould suggest ,Dracula,False
4320, he said we must havemore proof ,Dracula,False
4321,  he put on the coffin lid again gathered up all histh and placed them in the bag blew out the light andplaced the candle also in the bag ,Dracula,False

4328, thenhe told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst hewould watch at the other ,Dracula,False
4329, i took up my place behind a yew tree and i saw hisdark figure move until the interven headstone and treeshid it from my sight ,Dracula,False
4330, it wa a lonely vigil ,Dracula,False
4331, just after i had taken my place iheard a distant clock strike twelve and in time came one andtwo ,Dracula,False
4332,i wa chilled and unnerved and angry with the professorfor tak me on such an errand and with myself for com ,Dracula,False
4333,i wa too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant and notsleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether i had adreary miserable time ,Dracula,False
4334,  suddenly a i turned round i thought i saw somethinglike a white streak mov between two dark yew tree at theside of the churchyard farthest from the tomb ,Dracula,False
4335, at the sametime a dark mas moved from the professor' side of theground and hurriedly went toward it ,Dracula,False
4336, then i too moved buti had to go round headstone and railed off tomb and istumbled over grave ,Dracula,False
4337,the sky wa overcast and somewhere faroff an early cock crew ,Dracula,False
4338, a little way off beyond a line ofscattered juniper tree which marked the pathway to thechurch a white dim figure flitted in the direction of thetomb ,Dracula,False
4339, the tomb itself wa hidden by tree and i could notsee where the figure had disappeared ,Dracula,False
4340, i heard the rustle ofactual movement where i had first seen the white figure andcom over found the professor hold in hi arm a tinychild ,Dracula,False
4341, when he saw me he held it out to me and said areyou satisfied now ,Dracula,False
4342,  no i said in a way that i felt wa aggressive ,Dracula,False

4345,  we shall see said the professor and with one impulsewe took our way out of the churchyard he carry the sleep child ,Dracula,False
4346,  when we had got some little distance away we went intoa clump of tree and struck a match and looked at thechild' throat ,Dracula,False
4347, it wa without a scratch or scar of any kind ,Dracula,False
4348,  we were just in time said the professor thankfully ,Dracula,False
4349,  we had now to decide what we were to do with the child and so consulted about it ,Dracula,False
4350, if we were to take it to a policestation we should have to give some account of our movementsdur the night ,Dracula,False
4351, at least we should have had to make somestatement a to how we had come to find the child ,Dracula,False
4352,so finallywe decided that we would take it to the heath and when weheard a policeman com would leave it where he could notfail to find it ,Dracula,False
4353, we would then seek our way home a quicklya we could ,Dracula,False
4354, at the edge of hampsteadheath we heard a policeman' heavy tramp and lay thechild on the pathway we waited and watched until he saw ita he flashed hi lantern to and fro ,Dracula,False
4355, we heard hi exclam ation of astonishment and then we went away silently ,Dracula,False
4356, bygood chance we got a cab near the `spainiard ' and drove totown ,Dracula,False
4357,  i cannot sleep so i make thi entry ,Dracula,False
4358, but i must try toget a few hours' sleep a van hels i to call for me atnoon ,Dracula,False
4359, he insist that i go with him on another expedition ,Dracula,False

4361, the funeral held atnoon wa all completed and the last straggler of the mour ner had taken themselve lazily away when look care fully from behind a clump of alder tree we saw the sextonlock the gate after him ,Dracula,False
4362, we knew that we were safe tillmorn did we desire it but the professor told me that weshould not want more than an hour at most ,Dracula,False
4363, again i felt thathorrid sense of the reality of th in which any effort ofimagination seemed out of place and i realized distinctlythe peril of the law which we were incurr in our unhal lowed work ,Dracula,False
4364, beside i felt it wa all so usel ,Dracula,False
4365, outrag eou a it wa to open a leaden coffin to see if a womandead nearly a week were really dead it now seemed the heightof folly to open the tomb again when we knew from the evi dence of our own eyesight that the coffin wa empty ,Dracula,False
4366, ishrugged my shoulder however and rested silent for vanhels had a way of go on hi own road no matter whoremonstrated ,Dracula,False
4367, he took the key opened the vault and againcourteously motioned me to precede ,Dracula,False
4368, the place wa not sogruesome a last night but oh how unutterably mean lookingwhen the sunshine streamed in ,Dracula,False
4369, van hels walked over tolucy' coffin and i followed ,Dracula,False
4370, he bent over and again forcedback the leaden flange and a shock of surprise and dismayshot through me ,Dracula,False
4371,  there lay lucy seemingly just a we had seen her thenight before her funeral ,Dracula,False
4372, she wa if possible more radi antly beautiful than ever and i could not believe that shewa dead ,Dracula,False
4373, the lip were red nay redder than before andon the cheek wa a delicate bloom ,Dracula,False
4374,  i thi a juggle ,Dracula,False
4375,  are you convinced now ,Dracula,False

4377, see he went on they are even sharper than before ,Dracula,False
4378,with thi and thi and he touched one of the canine teethand that below it the little children can be bitten ,Dracula,False
4379, areyou of belief now friend john ,Dracula,False
4380,  once more argumentative hostility woke within me ,Dracula,False
4381, icould not accept such an overwhelm idea a he suggested ,Dracula,False
4382,so with an attempt to argue of which i wa even at the mom ent ashamed i said she may have been placed here sincelast night ,Dracula,False
4383, that i so and by whom ,Dracula,False
4384,  i do not know ,Dracula,False
4385,  and yet she ha been dead one week ,Dracula,False
4386, most people inthat time would not look so ,Dracula,False
4387,  i had no answer for thi so wa silent ,Dracula,False
4388, van helsingdid not seem to notice my silence ,Dracula,False
4389, at any rate he showedneither chagrin nor triumph ,Dracula,False
4390, he wa look intently at theface of the dead woman rais the eyelid and look atthe eye and once more open the lip and examin theteeth ,Dracula,False
4391, then he turned to me and said here there i one th which i different from allrecorded ,Dracula,False
4392, here i some dual life that i not a the common ,Dracula,False
4393,she wa bitten by the vampire when she wa in a trance sleep walk oh you start ,Dracula,False
4394, you do not know that friendjohn but you shall know it later and in trance could hebest come to take more blood ,Dracula,False
4395, in trance she die and intrance she i un dead too ,Dracula,False
4396, so it i that she differ fromall other ,Dracula,False
4397, usually when the un dead sleep at home a hespoke he made a comprehensive sweep of hi arm to designatewhat to a vampire wa `home' their face show what they are but thi so sweet that wa when she not un dead she go backto the noth of the common dead ,Dracula,False
4398, there i no malign there see and so it make hard that i must kill her in her sleep ,Dracula,False
4399,  thi turned my blood cold and it began to dawn upon methat i wa accept van helsing' theorie ,Dracula,False
4400, but if she werereally dead what wa there of terror in the idea of killingher ,Dracula,False
4401,  he looked up at me and evidently saw the change in myface for he said almost joyously ah you believe now ,Dracula,False
4402,  i answered do not pr me too hard all at once ,Dracula,False
4403, how will you do thi bloody work ,Dracula,False
4404,  i shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with gar lic and i shall drive a stake through her body ,Dracula,False
4405,  it made me shudder to think of so mutilat the bodyof the woman whom i had loved ,Dracula,False
4406, and yet the feel wa notso strong a i had expected ,Dracula,False
4407, i wa in fact beginn toshudder at the presence of thi be thi un dead a vanhels called it and to loathe it ,Dracula,False
4408, i it possible thatlove i all subjective or all objective ,Dracula,False
4409,  i waited a considerable time for van hels to begin but he stood a if wrapped in thought ,Dracula,False
4410, presently he closedthe catch of hi bag with a snap and said i have been think and have made up my mind a towhat i best ,Dracula,False
4411, if i did simply follow my inclin i woulddo now at thi moment what i to be done ,Dracula,False
4412, but there areother th to follow and th that are thousand timesmore difficult in that them we do not know ,Dracula,False
4413,she have yet no life taken though that i of time and toact now would be to take danger from her forever ,Dracula,False
4414, but thenwe may have to want arthur and how shall we tell him ofthis ,Dracula,False
4415, if you who saw the wound on lucy' throat and sawthe wound so similar on the child' at the hospital if you who saw the coffin empty last night and full today with awoman who have not change only to be more rose and more beau tiful in a whole week after she die if you know of thi andknow of the white figure last night that brought the childto the churchyard and yet of your own sense you did notbelieve how then can i expect arthur who know none ofthose th to believe ,Dracula,False
4416,  he doubted me when i took him from her kis when shewa dy ,Dracula,False
4417, i know he ha forgiven me because in some mis taken idea i have done th that prevent him say goodbyea he ought and he may think that in some more mistakenidea thi woman wa buried alive and that in most mistakeof all we have killed her ,Dracula,False
4418, he will then argue back that iti we mistaken one that have killed her by our idea andso he will be much unhappy alway ,Dracula,False
4419, yet he never can be sure and that i the worst of all ,Dracula,False
4420, and he will sometime thinkthat she he loved wa buried alive and that will paint hisdream with horror of what she must have suffered and again he will think that we may be right and that hi so belovedwa after all an un dead ,Dracula,False
4421, i told him once and sincethen i learn much ,Dracula,False
4422, now since i know it i all true a hun dred thousand time more do i know that he must pas throughthe bitter water to reach the sweet ,Dracula,False

8017, for had he power to move himself a he wished hecould go either a man or wolf or bat or in some otherway ,Dracula,False
8018, he evidently fear discovery or interference in thestate of helplessn in which he must be confined a he isbetween dawn and sunset in hi wooden box ,Dracula,False
8019,  (b) how i he to be taken ,Dracula,False
8020, here a proc of exclu sion may help u ,Dracula,False
8021, by road by rail by water ,Dracula,False
8022, there are endl difficultie especi ally in leav the city ,Dracula,False
8023,  (x) there are people ,Dracula,False
8024, and people are curiou andinvestigate ,Dracula,False
8025, a hint a surmise a doubt a to what might bein the box would destroy him ,Dracula,False
8026,  (y) there are or there may be custom and octroiofficer to pas ,Dracula,False
8027,  (z) hi pursuer might follow ,Dracula,False
8028, and in order to prevent hi be betrayed he hasrepelled so far a he can even hi victim me ,Dracula,False
8029, there i no one in charge of the box ,Dracula,False
8030, itwould have to take it chance of be delayed and delaywould be fatal with enemie on the track ,Dracula,False
8031, true he mightescape at night ,Dracula,False
8032, but what would he be if left in a strangeplace with no refuge that he could fly to ,Dracula,False
8033, thi i not whathe intend and he doe not mean to risk it ,Dracula,False
8034, here i the safest way in one respect but with most danger in another ,Dracula,False
8035, on the water he i power l except at night ,Dracula,False
8036, even then he can only summon fog andstorm and snow and hi wolve ,Dracula,False
8037, but were he wrecked theliv water would engulf him helpl and he would indeedbe lost ,Dracula,False
8038, he could have the vessel drive to land but if itwere unfriendly land wherein he wa not free to move hisposition would still be desperate ,Dracula,False
8039,  we know from the record that he wa on the water sowhat we have to do i to ascertain what water ,Dracula,False
8040,  the first th i to realize exactly what he ha donea yet ,Dracula,False
8041, we may then get a light on what hi task i to be ,Dracula,False
8042, we must differentiate between what he did inlondon a part of hi general plan of action when he waspressed for moment and had to arrange a best he could ,Dracula,False
8043,  secondly we must see a well a we can surmise it fromthe fact we know of what he ha done here ,Dracula,False
8044,  a to the first he evidently intended to arrive atgalatz and sent invoice to varna to deceive u lest weshould ascertain hi mean of exit from england ,Dracula,False
8045, hi immed iate and sole purpose then wa to escape ,Dracula,False
8046, the proof of thi i the letter of instruction sent ot immanuel hildesheim toclear and take away the box before sunrise ,Dracula,False
8047,there i also theinstruction to petrof skinsky ,Dracula,False
8048, these we must only gu at but there must have been some letter or message since skin sky came to hildesheim ,Dracula,False
8049,  that so far hi plan were successful we know ,Dracula,False
8050, theczarina catherine made a phenomenally quick journey ,Dracula,False
8051, so muchso that captain donelson' suspicion were aroused ,Dracula,False
8052, but hissuperstition united with hi cannin played the count'sgame for him and he ran with hi favor wind through fogsand all till he brought up blindfold at galatz ,Dracula,False
8053, that thecount' arrangement were well made ha been proved ,Dracula,False
8054,hilde sheim cleared the box took it off and gave it to skinsky ,Dracula,False
8055,skinsky took it and here we lose the trail ,Dracula,False
8056, we only knowthat the box i somewhere on the water mov along ,Dracula,False
8057, thecustom and the octroi if there be any have been avoided ,Dracula,False
8058,  now we come to what the count must have done after hisarrival on land at galatz ,Dracula,False
8059,  the box wa given to skinsky before sunrise ,Dracula,False
8060, at sun rise the count could appear in hi own form ,Dracula,False
8061, here we askwhy skinsky wa chosen at all to aid in the work ,Dracula,False
8062, in myhusband' diary skinsky i mentioned a deal with theslovak who trade down the river to the port ,Dracula,False
8063, and the man'sremark that the murder wa the work of a slovak showed thegeneral feel against hi clas ,Dracula,False
8064, the count wanted iso lation ,Dracula,False
8065,  my surmise i thi that in london the count decidedto get back to hi castle by water a the most safe andsecret way ,Dracula,False
8066, he wa brought from the castle by szgany andprobably they delivered their cargo to slovak who took theboxe to varna for there they were shipped to london ,Dracula,False
8067, thusthe count had knowledge of the person who could arrangethi service ,Dracula,False
8068, when the box wa on land before sunrise orafter sunset he came out from hi box met skinsky andinstructed him what to do a to arrang the carriage ofthe box up some river ,Dracula,False
8069, when thi wa done and he knew thatall wa in train he blotted out hi trace a he thought by murder hi agent ,Dracula,False
8070,  i have examined the map and find that the river mostsuitable for the slovak to have ascended i either thepruth or the sereth ,Dracula,False
8071, i read in the typescript that in mytrance i heard cow low and water swirl level with myear and the creak of wood ,Dracula,False
8072, the count in hi box then wa on a river in an open boat propelled probably eitherby oar or pole for the bank are near and it i workingagainst stream ,Dracula,False
8073, there would be no such if float downstream ,Dracula,False
8074,  of course it may not be either the sereth or the pruth but we may possibly investigate further ,Dracula,False
8075, now of these two the pruth i the more easily navigated but the sereth i at fundu joined by the bistritza which run up round theborgo pas ,Dracula,False
8076, the loop it make i manifestly a close todracula' castle a can be got by water ,Dracula,False
8077,  mina harker' journal continued  when i had done read jonathan took me in hi armsand kissed me ,Dracula,False

8082,our enemy i at hi most helpl ,Dracula,False
8083, and if we can come on himby day on the water our task will be over ,Dracula,False
8084, he ha a start but he i powerl to hasten a he may not leave thi boxlest those who carry him may suspect ,Dracula,False
8085, for them to suspectwould be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where heperish ,Dracula,False
8086, thi he know and will not ,Dracula,False

8090, said the professor both good ,Dracula,False
8091, there must be force to overcome force ifneed be ,Dracula,False
8092, the slovak i strong and rough and he carriesrude arms all the men smiled for amongst them theycarried a small arsenal ,Dracula,False
8093,  said morri i have brought some winchester ,Dracula,False
8094,they are pretty handy in a crowd and there may be wolve ,Dracula,False
