179, the carriage went at a hard pace straightalong then we made a complete turn and went along anotherstraight road ,Dracula,False

188,  at the first howl the horse began to strain and rear but the driver spoke to them soothingly and they quieteddown but shivered and sweated a though after a runawayfrom sudden fright ,Dracula,False
189, then far off in the distance from themountain on each side of u began a louder and a sharperhowling that of wolve which affected both the horse andmyself in the same way ,Dracula,False
190, for i wa minded to jump from thecaleche and run whilst they reared again and plunged madly so that the driver had to use all hi great strength to keepthem from bolting ,Dracula,False
191, in a few minute however my own earsgot accustomed to the sound and the horse so far becamequiet that the driver wa able to descend and to stand be fore them ,Dracula,False

200, the baying of the wolve sounded nearer and near er a though they were closing round on u from every side ,Dracula,False
201,i grew dreadfully afraid and the horse shared my fear ,Dracula,False
202, thedriver however wa not in the least disturbed ,Dracula,False
203,he kept turn ing hi head to left and right but i could not see anythingthrough the darkn ,Dracula,False
204,  suddenly away on our left i saw a fain flickering blueflame ,Dracula,False
205, the driver saw it at the same moment ,Dracula,False
206, he at oncechecked the horse and jumping to the ground disappearedinto the darkn ,Dracula,False
207, i did not know what to do the l asthe howling of the wolve grew closer ,Dracula,False
208, but while i wondered the driver suddenly appeared again and without a word tookhi seat and we resumed our journey ,Dracula,False
209, i think i must havefallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident for itseemed to be repeated endlessly and now looking back it islike a sort of awful nightmare ,Dracula,False
210, once the flame appeared sonear the road that even in the darkn around u i couldwatch the driver motion ,Dracula,False
211, he went rapidly to where theblue flame arose it must have been very faint for it didnot seem to illumine the place around it at all and gather ing a few stone formed them into some device ,Dracula,False
212,  once there appeared a strange optical effect ,Dracula,False
213, when hestood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it for icould see it ghostly flicker all the same ,Dracula,False
214,thi startled me but a the effect wa only momentary i took it that my eyesdeceived me straining through the darkn ,Dracula,False
215, then for a timethere were no blue flame and we sped onward through thegloom with the howling of the wolve around u a thoughthey were following in a moving circle ,Dracula,False
216,  at last there came a time when the driver went furtherafield than he had yet gone and during hi absence thehorse began to tremble worse than ever and to snort andscream with fright ,Dracula,False
217,i could not see any cause for it for thehowling of the wolve had ceased altogether ,Dracula,False
218, but just thenthe moon sailing through the black cloud appeared behindthe jagged crest of a beetling pine clad rock and by itslight i saw around u a ring of wolve with white teeth andlolling red tongue with long sinewy limb and shaggy hair ,Dracula,False
219,they were a hundred time more terrible in the grim silencewhich held them than even when they howled ,Dracula,False
220, for myself ifelt a sort of paralysi of fear ,Dracula,False
221,it i only when a man feelshimself face to face with such horror that he can under stand their true import ,Dracula,False
222,  all at once the wolve began to howl a though the moon light had had some peculiar effect on them ,Dracula,False
223,the horse jumpedabout and reared and looked helplessly round with eye thatrolled in a way painful to see ,Dracula,False
224,but the living ring of terrorencompassed them on every side and they had perforce toremain within it ,Dracula,False
225, i called to the coachman to come for itseemed to me that our only chance wa to try to break outthrough the ring and to aid hi approach i shouted and beatthe side of the caleche hoping by the noise to scare thewolve from the side so a to give him a chance of reachingthe trap ,Dracula,False
226, how he came there i know not but i heard hisvoice raised in a tone of imperiou command and lookingtoward the sound saw him stand in the roadway ,Dracula,False
227, a he swepthi long arm a though brushing aside some impalpableobstacle the wolve fell back and back further still ,Dracula,False
228, justthen a heavy cloud passed acros the face of the moon sothat we were again in darkn ,Dracula,False
229,  when i could see again the driver wa climbing into thecaleche and the wolve disappeared ,Dracula,False
230, thi wa all so strangeand uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me and i wasafraid to speak or move ,Dracula,False

232,  we kept on ascending with occasional period of quickdescent but in the main alway ascending ,Dracula,False
233,suddenly i becameconsciou of the fact that the driver wa in the act of pull ing up the horse in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle from whose tall black window came no ray of light and whosebroken battlement showed a jagged line against the sky ,Dracula,False

509,  the view wa magnificent and from where i stood therewa every opportunity of seeing it ,Dracula,False
510, the castle i on thevery edge of a terrific precipice ,Dracula,False
511, a stone falling from thewindow would fall a thousand feet without touching anything ,Dracula,False
512,a far a the eye can reach i a sea of green tree top withoccasionally a deep rift where there i a chasm ,Dracula,False

520, when i look back after a few hour ithink i must have been mad for the time for i behaved mucha a rat doe in a trap ,Dracula,False
521, when however the conviction hadcome to me that i wa helpl i sat down quietly a quiet ly a i have ever done anything in my life and began tothink over what wa best to be done ,Dracula,False
522, i am thinking still and a yet have come to no definite conclusion ,Dracula,False
523, of one thingonly am i certain ,Dracula,False
524, that it i no use making my idea knownto the count ,Dracula,False
525, he know well that i am imprisoned and a heha done it himself and ha doubtl hi own motive forit he would only deceive me if i trusted him fully with thefact ,Dracula,False
526, so far a i can see my only plan will be to keep myknowledge and my fear to myself and my eye open ,Dracula,False
527, i am iknow either being deceived like a baby by my own fear or else i am in desperate strait and if the latter be so i need and shall need all my brain to get through ,Dracula,False
528,  i had hardly come to thi conclusion when i heard thegreat door below shut and knew that the count had returned ,Dracula,False

538, it i odd that a thing which i have been taught toregard with disfavour and a idolatrou should in a time oflonelin and trouble be of help ,Dracula,False
539, i it that there i some thing in the essence of the thing itself or that it i amedium a tangible help in conveying memorie of sympathyand comfort ,Dracula,False

573,  it wa by thi time close on morning and we went tobed ,Dracula,False
574, thi diary seem horribly like the beginning ofthe arabian night for everything ha to break off atcockcrow or like the ghost of hamlet father ,Dracula,False
575, let me begin with fact bare meager fact verified by book and figure and of which there can be nodoubt ,Dracula,False
576, i must not confuse them with experience which willhave to rest on my own observation or my memory of them ,Dracula,False
577,last evening when the count came from hi room he began byasking me question on legal matter and on the doing ofcertain kind of busin ,Dracula,False
578, i had spent the day wearily overbook and simply to keep my mind occupied went over someof the matter i had been examined in at lincoln inn ,Dracula,False
579,therewa a certain method in the count inquirie so i shalltry to put them down in sequence ,Dracula,False
580, the knowledge may somehowor some time be useful to me ,Dracula,False
581,  first he asked if a man in england might have two so licitor or more ,Dracula,False
582, i told him he might have a dozen if hewished but that it would not be wise to have more than onesolicitor engaged in one transaction a only one could actat a time and that to change would be certain to militateagainst hi interest ,Dracula,False
583, he seemed thoroughly to understand and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficul ty in having one man to attend say to banking and anotherto look after shipping in case local help were needed in aplace far from the home of the banking solicitor ,Dracula,False
584, i askedto explain more fully so that i might not by any chancemislead him so he said i shall illustrate ,Dracula,False
585, your friend and mine mr peterhawkin from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedralat exeter which i far from london buy for me throughyour good self my place at london ,Dracula,False
586, now here let mesay frankly lest you should think it strange that i havesought the service of one so far off from london instead ofsome one resident there that my motive wa that no localinterest might be served save my wish only and a one oflondon residence might perhap have some purpose of himselfor friend to serve i went thu afield to seek my agent whose labour should be only to my interest ,Dracula,False
587, now suppose i who have much of affair wish to ship good say to new castle or durham or harwich or dover might it not be thatit could with more ease be done by consigning to one inthese ports ,Dracula,False
588,  i answered that certainly it would be most easy butthat we solicitor had a system of agency one for the other so that local work could be done locally on instruction fromany solicitor so that the client simply placing himselfin the hand of one man could have hi wishe carried outby him without further trouble ,Dracula,False
589,  but said he i could be at liberty to direct myself ,Dracula,False
590,  of course i replied and such i often done by menof busin who do not like the whole of their affair to beknown by any one person ,Dracula,False
591, he said and then went on to ask about the meansof making consignment and the form to be gone through andof all sort of difficultie which might arise but by fore thought could be guarded against ,Dracula,False
592, i explained all thesething to him to the best of my ability and he certainlyleft me under the impression that he would have made awonderful solicitor for there wa nothing that he did notthink of or foresee ,Dracula,False
593, for a man who wa never in the country and who did not evidently do much in the way of busin hisknowledge and acumen were wonderful ,Dracula,False
594, when he had satisfiedhimself on these point of which he had spoken and i hadverified all a well a i could by the book available hesuddenly stood up and said have you written since yourfirst letter to our friend mr peter hawkin or to anyother ,Dracula,False
595,  it wa with some bittern in my heart that i answeredthat i had not that a yet i had not seen any opportunityof sending letter to anybody ,Dracula,False

601,  what could i do but bow acceptance ,Dracula,False
602, it wa mrhawkinsinterest not mine and i had to think of him not myself and beside while count dracula wa speaking there wasthat in hi eye and in hi bearing which made me rememberthat i wa a prisoner and that if i wished it i could haveno choice ,Dracula,False
603, the count saw hi victory in my bow and hi mas tery in the trouble of my face for he began at once to usethem but in hi own smooth resistl way ,Dracula,False
604,  i pray you my good young friend that you will notdiscourse of thing other than busin in your letter ,Dracula,False

606, a he spoke he handed me three sheet of note paperand three envelope ,Dracula,False
607, they were all of the thinnest foreignpost and looking at them then at him and noticing hisquiet smile with the sharp canine teeth lying over the redunderlip i understood a well a if he had spoken that ishould be more careful what i wrote for he would be able toread it ,Dracula,False
608, so i determined to write only formal note now butto write fully to mr hawkin in secret and also to mina for to her i could write shorthand which would puzzle thecount if he did see it ,Dracula,False
609, when i had written my two letter isat quiet reading a book whilst the count wrote severalnote referring a he wrote them to some book on hi table ,Dracula,False
610,then he took up my two and placed them with hi own and putby hi writing material after which the instant the doorhad closed behind him i leaned over and looked at the lett er which were face down on the table ,Dracula,False

624, should sleep now or ever overcome you or be like todo then haste to your own chamber or to these room foryour rest will then be safe ,Dracula,False
625, but if you be not careful inthi respect then he finished hi speech in a gruesomeway for he motioned with hi hand a if he were washingthem ,Dracula,False
626, my only doubt wa a to whetherany dream could be more terrible than the unnatural horriblenet of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me ,Dracula,False
627, i endorse the last word written but thi timethere i no doubt in question ,Dracula,False
628, i shall not fear to sleep inany place where he i not ,Dracula,False

631,after a little while not hearing any sound i came out and went up the stone stairto where i could look out toward the south ,Dracula,False
632, there wa somesense of freedom in the vast expanse inaccessible though itwa to me a compared with the narrow darkn of the court yard ,Dracula,False
633, looking out on thi i felt that i wa indeed in pri son and i seemed to want a breath of fresh air though itwere of the night ,Dracula,False

639, in the soft light the distant hill became melted and the shadow in the valley and gorge of velvety black n ,Dracula,False
640, the mere beauty seemed to cheer me ,Dracula,False
641, there wa peaceand comfort in every breath i drew ,Dracula,False
642,a i leaned from the win dow my eye wa caught by something moving a storey below me and somewhat to my left where i imagined from the order ofthe room that the window of the count own room wouldlook out ,Dracula,False
643, the window at which i stood wa tall and deep stone mullioned and though weatherworn wa still complete ,Dracula,False
644,but it wa evidently many a day since the case had beenthere ,Dracula,False
645,i drew back behind the stonework and looked carefullyout ,Dracula,False
646,  what i saw wa the count head coming out from thewindow ,Dracula,False
647, i did not see the face but i knew the man by theneck and the movement of hi back and arm in any case icould not mistake the hand which i had had some many oppor tunitie of studying ,Dracula,False
648, i wa at first interested and somewhatamused for it i wonderful how small a matter will interestand amuse a man when he i a prisoner ,Dracula,False
649, but my very feelingschanged to repulsion and terror when i saw the whole manslowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down thecastle wall over the dreadful abys face down with hi cloakspreading out around him like great wing ,Dracula,False
650, at first i couldnot believe my eye ,Dracula,False
651,i thought it wa some trick of the moon light some weird effect of shadow but i kept looking andit could be no delusion ,Dracula,False
652,i saw the finger and toe grasp thecorner of the stone worn clear of the mortar by the stressof year and by thu using every projection and inequalitymove downward with considerable speed just a a lizardmove along a wall ,Dracula,False
653,  what manner of man i thi or what manner of creature i it in the semblance of man ,Dracula,False

657, once more i have seen the count go out in hislizard fashion ,Dracula,False
658, he moved downward in a sidelong way somehundred feet down and a good deal to the left ,Dracula,False
659, he vanishedinto some hole or window ,Dracula,False
660, when hi head had disappeared ileaned out to try and see more but without avail ,Dracula,False
661, the dis tance wa too great to allow a proper angle of sight ,Dracula,False
662, i knewhe had left the castle now and thought to use the opportun ity to explore more than i had dared to do a yet ,Dracula,False
663, i wentback to the room and taking a lamp tried all the door ,Dracula,False
664,they were all locked a i had expected and the lock werecomparatively new ,Dracula,False

671, one or twosmall room near the hall were open but there wa nothingto see in them except old furniture dusty with age andmoth eaten ,Dracula,False
672, at last however i found one door at the top ofthe stairway which though it seemed locked gave a littleunder pressure ,Dracula,False
673, i tried it harder and found that it wa notreally locked but that the resistance came from the factthat the hinge had fallen somewhat and the heavy door rest ed on the floor ,Dracula,False
674, here wa an opportunity which i might nothave again so i exerted myself and with many effort forcedit back so that i could enter ,Dracula,False

681,  the window were curtainl and the yellow moonlight flooding in through the diamond pane enabled one to seeeven colour whilst it softened the wealth of dust which layover all and disguised in some measure the ravage of timeand moth ,Dracula,False
682,my lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brill iant moonlight but i wa glad to have it with me for therewa a dread lonelin in the place which chilled my heartand made my nerve tremble ,Dracula,False
683, still it wa better than livingalone in the room which i had come to hate from the pre sence of the count and after trying a little to school mynerve i found a soft quietude come over me ,Dracula,False
684, here i am sitting at a little oak table where in old time possiblysome fair lady sat to pen with much thought and many blushe her ill spelt love letter and writing in my diary in short hand all that ha happened since i closed it last ,Dracula,False

1577, saturday even ing wa a fine a wa ever known and the great body ofholiday maker laid out yesterday for visit to mulgravewood robin hood bay rig mill runswick staithe andthe variou trip in the neighborhood of whitby ,Dracula,False
1578, thesteamer emma and scarborough made trip up and down thecoast and there wa an unusual amount of `tripping bothto and from whitby ,Dracula,False
1579, the day wa unusually fine till theafternoon when some of the gossip who frequent the eastcliff churchyard and from the commanding eminence watchthe wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east calledattention to a sudden show of `mare tails high in the skyto the northwest ,Dracula,False
1580, the wind wa then blowing from the south west in the mild degree which in barometrical language isranked `no ,Dracula,False
1581,  the coastguard on duty at once made report and one oldfisherman who for more than half a century ha kept watch onweather sign from the east cliff foretold in an emphaticmanner the coming of a sudden storm ,Dracula,False
1582, the approach of sunsetwa so very beautiful so grand in it masse of splendidlycoloured cloud that there wa quite an assemblage on thewalk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy thebeauty ,Dracula,False
1583,before the sun dipped below the black mas of kettle n standing boldly athwart the western sky it downwardwa wa marked by myriad cloud of every sunset colour flame purple pink green violet and all the tint ofgold with here and there masse not large but of seeminglyabsolute blackn in all sort of shape a well outlineda colossal silhouette ,Dracula,False
1584, the experience wa not lost on thepainter and doubtl some of the sketche of the `preludeto the great storm will grace the r ,Dracula,False
1585,  more than one captain made up hi mind then and therethat hi `cobble or hi `mule a they term the differentclasse of boat would remain in the harbour till the stormhad passed ,Dracula,False
1586, the wind fell away entirely during the evening and at midnight there wa a dead calm a sultry heat andthat prevailing intensity which on the approach of thunder affect person of a sensitive nature ,Dracula,False
1587,  there were but few light in sight at sea for eventhe coasting steamer which usually hug the shore so closely kept well to seaward and but few fishing boat were in sight ,Dracula,False
1588,the only sail noticeable wa a foreign schooner with allsail set which wa seemingly going westward ,Dracula,False
1589,the foolhard in or ignorance of her officer wa a prolific theme forcomment whilst she remained in sight and effort were madeto signal her to reduce sail in the face of her danger ,Dracula,False
1590, be fore the night shut down she wa seen with sail idly flapp ing a she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea ,Dracula,False
1591,  a idle a a painted ship upon a painted ocean ,Dracula,False
1592,  shortly before ten oclock the stilln of the airgrew quite oppressive and the silence wa so marked that thebleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in thetown wa distinctly heard and the band on the pier withit lively french air wa like a dischord in the great har mony of nature silence ,Dracula,False
1593, a little after midnight came astrange sound from over the sea and high overhead the airbegan to carry a strange faint hollow booming ,Dracula,False
1594,  then without warning the tempest broke ,Dracula,False
1595, with a rapiditywhich at the time seemed incredible and even afterward isimpossible to realize the whole aspect of nature at oncebecame convulsed ,Dracula,False
1596, the wave rose in growing fury each over topping it fellow till in a very few minute the latelyglassy sea wa like a roaring and devouring monster ,Dracula,False
1597, white crested wave beat madly on the level sand and rushed upthe shelving cliff ,Dracula,False
1598, other broke over the pier and withtheir spume swept the lanthorn of the lighthouse whichrise from the end of either pier of whitby harbour ,Dracula,False
1599,  the wind roared like thunder and blew with such forcethat it wa with difficulty that even strong men kept theirfeet or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchion ,Dracula,False
1600, itwa found necessary to clear the entire pier from the massof onlooker or else the fatalitie of the night would haveincreased manifold ,Dracula,False
1601, to add to the difficultie and dangersof the time masse of sea fog came drifting inland ,Dracula,False
1602, white wet cloud which swept by in ghostly fashion so dank anddamp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagina tion to think that the spirit of those lost at sea weretouching their living brethren with the clammy hand ofdeath and many a one shuddered at the wreath of sea mistswept by ,Dracula,False
1603,  at time the mist cleared and the sea for some dis tance could be seen in the glare of the lightning whichcame thick and fast followed by such peal of thunder thatthe whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock ofthe footstep of the storm ,Dracula,False
1604,  some of the scene thu revealed were of immeasurablegrandeur and of absorbing interest ,Dracula,False
1605, the sea running mount ain high threw skyward with each wave mighty masse ofwhite foam which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirlaway into space ,Dracula,False
1606, here and there a fishing boat with a ragof sail running madly for shelter before the blast now andagain the white wing of a storm tossed seabird ,Dracula,False
1607, on thesummit of the east cliff the new searchlight wa ready forexperiment but had not yet been tried ,Dracula,False
1608, the officer incharge of it got it into working order and in the pause ofonrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea ,Dracula,False
1609, once ortwice it service wa most effective a when a fishing boat with gunwale under water rushed into the harbour able bythe guidance of the sheltering light to avoid the danger ofdashing against the pier ,Dracula,False
1610, a each boat achieved the safetyof the port there wa a shout of joy from the mas of peopleon the shore a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave thegale and wa then swept away in it rush ,Dracula,False
1611,  before long the searchlight discovered some distanceaway a schooner with all sail set apparently the same ves sel which had been noticed earlier in the evening ,Dracula,False
1612, the windhad by thi time backed to the east and there wa a shudderamongst the watcher on the cliff a they realized the terr ible danger in which she now wa ,Dracula,False
1613,  between her and the port lay the great flat reef onwhich so many good ship have from time to time suffered and with the wind blowing from it present quarter it wouldbe quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance ofthe harbour ,Dracula,False
1614,  it wa now nearly the hour of high tide but the waveswere so great that in their trough the shallow of theshore were almost visible and the schooner with all sailsset wa rushing with such speed that in the word of oneold salt she must fetch up somewhere if it wa only inhell ,Dracula,False
1615, then came another rush of sea fog greater than anyhitherto a mas of dank mist which seemed to close on allthing like a gray pall and left available to men only theorgan of hearing for the roar of the tempest and the crashof the thunder and the booming of the mighty billow camethrough the damp oblivion even louder than before ,Dracula,False
1616, the raysof the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouthacros the east pier where the shock wa expected and menwaited breathl ,Dracula,False
1617,  the wind suddenly shifted to the northeast and theremnant of the sea fog melted in the blast ,Dracula,False
1618, and then mirabile dictu between the pier leaping from wave to wavea it rushed at headlong speed swept the strange schoonerbefore the blast with all sail set and gained the safetyof the harbour ,Dracula,False
1619, the searchlight followed her and a shudderran through all who saw her for lashed to the helm wa acorpse with drooping head which swung horribly to and froat each motion of the ship ,Dracula,False
1620, no other form could be seen onthe deck at all ,Dracula,False
1621,  a great awe came on all a they realised that the ship a if by a miracle had found the harbour unsteered save bythe hand of a dead man ,Dracula,False
1622, however all took place more quicklythan it take to write these word ,Dracula,False
1623, the schooner paused not but rushing acros the harbour pitched herself on thataccumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tide andmany storm into the southeast corner of the pier juttingunder the east cliff known locally a tate hill pier ,Dracula,False
1624,  there wa of course a considerable concussion a thevessel drove up on the sand heap ,Dracula,False
1625, every spar rope and staywa strained and some of the `top hammer came crashing down ,Dracula,False
1626,but strangest of all the very instant the shore wa touched an immense dog sprang up on deck from below a if shot up bythe concussion and running forward jumped from the bow onthe sand ,Dracula,False
1627,  making straight for the steep cliff where the church yard hang over the laneway to the east pier so steeply thatsome of the flat tombstone thruffstean or through stone a they call them in whitby vernacular actually projectover where the sustaining cliff ha fallen away it disa ppeared in the darkn which seemed intensified justbeyond the focu of the searchlight ,Dracula,False
1628,  it so happened that there wa no one at the moment ontate hill pier a all those whose house are in close prox imity were either in bed or were out on the height above ,Dracula,False
1629,thu the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the har bour who at once ran down to the little pier wa the firstto climb aboard ,Dracula,False
1630, the men working the searchlight afterscouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there ,Dracula,False
1631, thecoastguard ran aft and when he came beside the wheel bentover to examine it and recoiled at once a though under somesudden emotion ,Dracula,False
1632, thi seemed to pique general curiosity andquite a number of people began to run ,Dracula,False
1633,  it i a good way round from the west cliff by the draw bridge to tate hill pier but your correspondent i a fairlygood runner and came well ahead of the crowd ,Dracula,False
1634, when i arri ved however i found already assembled on the pier a crowd whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come onboard ,Dracula,False
1635, by the courtesy of the chief boatman i wa a yourcorrespondent permitted to climb on deck and wa one of asmall group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashedto the wheel ,Dracula,False
1636,  it wa no wonder that the coastguard wa surprised oreven awed for not often can such a sight have been seen ,Dracula,False
1637,the man wa simply fastened by hi hand tied one over theother to a spoke of the wheel ,Dracula,False
1638, between the inner hand andthe wood wa a crucifix the set of bead on which it wasfastened being around both wrist and wheel and all keptfast by the binding cord ,Dracula,False
1639, the poor fellow may have beenseated at one time but the flapping and buffeting of thesail had worked through the rudder of the wheel and haddragged him to and fro so that the cord with which hewa tied had cut the flesh to the bone ,Dracula,False
1640,  accurate note wa made of the state of thing and adoctor surgeon j ,Dracula,False
1641, caffyn of number east elliot place whocame immediately after me declared after making examina tion that the man must have been dead for quite two day ,Dracula,False
1642,  in hi pocket wa a bottle carefully corked emptysave for a little roll of paper which proved to be theaddendum to the log ,Dracula,False
1643,  the coastguard said the man must have tied up hi ownhand fastening the knot with hi teeth ,Dracula,False
1644, the fact that acoastguard wa the first on board may save some complica tion later on in the admiralty court for coastguardscannot claim the salvage which i the right of the firstcivilian entering on a derelict ,Dracula,False
1645, already however the legaltongue are wagging and one young law student i loudlyasserting that the right of the owner are already complete ly sacrificed hi property being held in contravention ofthe statue of mortmain since the tiller a emblemship ifnot proof of delegated possession i held in a dead hand ,Dracula,False
1646,  it i needl to say that the dead steersman ha beenreverently removed from the place where he held hi honour able watch and ward till death a steadfastn a noble asthat of the young casabianca and placed in the mortuary toawait inquest ,Dracula,False

1658, a the matter i to be a `nineday wonder they are evidently determined that there shallbe no cause of other complaint ,Dracula,False
1659,  a good deal of interest wa abroad concerning the dogwhich landed when the ship struck and more than a few ofthe member of the ,Dracula,False

3281,  when i got back quincey wa waiting for me ,Dracula,False
3282, i told himi would see him a soon a i knew about lucy and went up toher room ,Dracula,False
3283, she wa still sleeping and the professor seeminglyhad not moved from hi seat at her side ,Dracula,False
3284, from hi putting hisfinger to hi lip i gathered that he expected her to wakebefore long and wa afraid of fore stalling nature ,Dracula,False
3285, so i wentdown to quincey and took him into the breakfast room wherethe blind were not drawn down and which wa a little morecheerful or rather l cheerl than the other room  when we were alone he said to me jack seward i dontwant to shove myself in anywhere where ive no right to be but thi i no ordinary case ,Dracula,False
3286, you know i loved that girl andwanted to marry her but although that all past and gone icant help feeling anxiou about her all the same ,Dracula,False
3287, what isit that wrong with her ,Dracula,False
3288, the dutchman and a fine old fellowi i i can see that said that time you two came into theroom that you must have another transfusion of blood andthat both you and he were exhausted ,Dracula,False
3289, now i know well that youmedical men speak in camera and that a man must not expectto know what they consult about in private ,Dracula,False
3290, but thi i nocommon matter and whatever it i i have done my part ,Dracula,False
3291,  that so i said and he went on ,Dracula,False
3292,  i take it that both you and van helsing had done al ready what i did today ,Dracula,False
3293,  and i gu art wa in it too ,Dracula,False
3294, when i saw him fourday ago down at hi own place he looked queer ,Dracula,False
3295, i have notseen anything pulled down so quick since i wa on the pampasand had a mare that i wa fond of go to gras all in a night ,Dracula,False
3296,one of those big bat that they call vampire had got at herin the night and what with hi gorge and the vein left open there wasnt enough blood in her to let her stand up and ihad to put a bullet through her a she lay ,Dracula,False
3297, jack if youmay tell me without betraying confidence arthur wa thefirst i not that so ,Dracula,False
3298,  a he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxiou ,Dracula,False
3299, hewa in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved and hi utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seem ed to surround her intensified hi pain ,Dracula,False
3300, hi very heartwa bleeding and it took all the manhood of him and therewa a royal lot of it too to keep him from breaking down ,Dracula,False
3301,i paused before answering for i felt that i must not betrayanything which the professor wished kept secret but alreadyhe knew so much and guessed so much that there could be noreason for not answering so i answered in the same phrase ,Dracula,False
3302,  and how long ha thi been going on ,Dracula,False
3303, then i gu jack seward that that poorpretty creature that we all love ha had put into her veinswithin that time the blood of four strong men ,Dracula,False
3304, man alive her whole body wouldnt hold it ,Dracula,False
3305, then coming close to me he spoke in a fierce half whisper ,Dracula,False
3306,  i shook my head ,Dracula,False
3307, that i said i the crux ,Dracula,False
3308, vanhelsing i simply frantic about it and i am at my wits end ,Dracula,False
3309,i cant even hazard a gu ,Dracula,False
3310, there ha been a serie oflittle circumstance which have thrown out all our calcula tion a to lucy being properly watched ,Dracula,False
3311, but these shallnot occur again ,Dracula,False
3312, here we stay until all be well or ill ,Dracula,False
3313,  quincey held out hi hand ,Dracula,False
3314, count me in he said ,Dracula,False
3315, youand the dutchman will tell me what to do and ill do it ,Dracula,False
3316,  when she woke late in the afternoon lucy first move ment wa to feel in her breast and to my surprise producedthe paper which van helsing had given me to read ,Dracula,False
3317, the care ful professor had replaced it where it had come from leston waking she should be alarmed ,Dracula,False
3318, her eye then lit on vanhelsing and on me too and gladdened ,Dracula,False
3319, then she looked roundthe room and seeing where she wa shuddered ,Dracula,False
3320, she gave aloud cry and put her poor thin hand before her pale face ,Dracula,False
3321,  we both understood what wa meant that she had real ized to the full her mother death ,Dracula,False
3322, so we tried what wecould to comfort her ,Dracula,False
3323, doubtl sympathy eased her somewhat but she wa very low in thought and spirit and wept silentlyand weakly for a long time ,Dracula,False
3324, we told her that either or bothof u would now remain with her all the time and that seemedto comfort her ,Dracula,False
3325, toward dusk she fell into a doze ,Dracula,False
3326, here avery odd thing occurred ,Dracula,False
3327, whilst still asleep she took thepaper from her breast and tore it in two ,Dracula,False
3328,van helsing steppedover and took the piece from her ,Dracula,False
3329, all the same however she went on with the action of tearing a though the mater ial were still in her hand ,Dracula,False
3330, finally she lifted her handsand opened them a though scattering the fragment ,Dracula,False
3331, vanhelsing seemed surprised and hi brow gathered a if inthought but he said nothing ,Dracula,False
3332, all last night she slept fitfully beingalway afraid to sleep and something weaker when she wokefrom it ,Dracula,False
3333, the professor and i took in turn to watch and wenever left her for a moment unattended ,Dracula,False
3334, quincey morri saidnothing about hi intention but i knew that all night longhe patrolled round and round the house ,Dracula,False
3335,  when the day came it searching light showed the rav age in poor lucy strength ,Dracula,False
3336, she wa hardly able to turnher head and the little nourishment which she could takeseemed to do her no good ,Dracula,False
3337, at time she slept and both vanhelsing and i noticed the difference in her between sleep ing and waking ,Dracula,False
3338, whilst asleep she looked stronger althoughmore haggard and her breathing wa softer ,Dracula,False
3339, her open mouthshowed the pale gum drawn back from the teeth which lookedpositively longer and sharper than usual ,Dracula,False
3340, when she woke thesoftn of her eye evidently changed the expression forshe looked her own self although a dying one ,Dracula,False
3341, in the after noon she asked for arthur and we telegraphed for him ,Dracula,False

3446,youshall lie on one and i on the other and our sympathy willbe comfort to each other even though we do not speak andeven if we sleep ,Dracula,False
3447,  arthur went off with him casting back a longing lookon lucy face which lay in her pillow almost whiter thanthe lawn ,Dracula,False
3448, she lay quite still and i looked around the roomto see that all wa a it should be ,Dracula,False
3449, i could see that theprofessor had carried out in thi room a in the other hispurpose of using the garlic ,Dracula,False
3450, the whole of the window sashesreeked with it and round lucy neck over the silk hand kerchief which van helsing made her keep on wa a roughchaplet of the same odorou flower ,Dracula,False
3451,  lucy wa breathing somewhat stertorously and her facewa at it worst for the open mouth showed the pale gumsher teeth in the dim uncertain light seemed longer andsharper than they had been in the morning ,Dracula,False
3452, in particular by some trick of the light the canine teeth looked longerand sharper than the rest ,Dracula,False
3453,  i sat down beside her and presently she moved uneas ily ,Dracula,False
3454, at the same moment there came a sort of dull flappingor buffeting at the window ,Dracula,False
3455, i went over to it softly andpeeped out by the corner of the blind ,Dracula,False
3456, there wa a fullmoonlight and i could see that the noise wa made by a greatbat which wheeled around doubtl attracted by the light although so dim and every now and again struck the windowwith it wing ,Dracula,False

3461,there did not seem to be with her now the unconsciou strug gle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked herilln ,Dracula,False
3462, it struck me a curiou that the moment she becameconsciou she pressed the garlic flower close to her ,Dracula,False
3463, itwa certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargicstate with the stertorou breathing she put the flowersfrom her but that when she waked she clutched them close there wa no possibility of making amy mistake about thi for in the long hour that followed she had many spellsof sleeping and waking and repeated both action many time ,Dracula,False
3464,  at six oclock van helsing came to relieve me ,Dracula,False
3465, arthurhad then fallen into a doze and he mercifully let him sleepon ,Dracula,False
3466, when he saw lucy face i could hear the sissing indrawof breath and he said to me in a sharp whisper ,Dracula,False
3467, then he bent down and with hi facealmost touching lucy examined her carefully ,Dracula,False

3481, i assured him that lucy wa still asleep but told him a gently a i could that both van helsing andi feared that the end wa near ,Dracula,False
3482, he covered hi face with hishand and slid down on hi knee by the sofa where he re mained perhap a minute with hi head buried praying whilst hi shoulder shook with grief ,Dracula,False

3487,he had even brushed lucy hair so that it lay on thepillow in it usual sunny ripple ,Dracula,False
3488, when we came into theroom she opened her eye and seeing him whispered softly arthur ,Dracula,False

3491, no he whispered not yet ,Dracula,False
3492, hold her hand itwill comfort her more ,Dracula,False
3493,  so arthur took her hand and knelt beside her and shelooked her best with all the soft line matching the angelicbeauty of her eye ,Dracula,False
3494, then gradually her eye closed and shesank to sleep ,Dracula,False
3495, for a little bit her breast heaved softly and her breath came and went like a tired child ,Dracula,False
3496,  and then insensibly there came the strange change whichi had noticed in the night ,Dracula,False
3497, her breathing grew stertorou the mouth opened and the pale gum drawn back made theteeth look longer and sharper than ever ,Dracula,False
3498, in a sort of sleep waking vague unconsciou way she opened her eye whichwere now dull and hard at once and said in a soft voluptuousvoice such a i had never heard from her lip arthur ,Dracula,False
3499, oh my love i am so glad you have come ,Dracula,False
3500,  arthur bent eagerly over to kis her but at that in stant van helsing who like me had been startled by hervoice swooped upon him and catching him by the neck withboth hand dragged him back with a fury of strength whichi never thought he could have possessed and actually hurl ed him almost acros the room ,Dracula,False

3502, and he stood between them like a lion at bay ,Dracula,False

3504,  i kept my eye fixed on lucy a did van helsing andwe saw a spasm a of rage flit like a shadow over her face ,Dracula,False

3624, sheknew not altogether what she did and thu unknowing sheonly stole ,Dracula,False
3625, he went away on the word leaving me with a new mystery to think of a new puzzle tograpple with ,Dracula,False

3631, when he had told u so muchhe went on frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentarydisposition and pointed out certain contingencie that mightleave her daughter either pennil or not so free a sheshould be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance ,Dracula,False
3632, indeed we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into colli sion for she asked u if we were or were not prepared tocarry out her wishe ,Dracula,False
3633, of course we had then no alternativebut to accept ,Dracula,False
3634, we were right in principle and ninety ninetime out of a hundred we should have proved by the logic ofevent the accuracy of our judgment ,Dracula,False
3635,  frankly however i must admit that in thi case anyother form of disposition would have rendered impossible thecarrying out of her wishe ,Dracula,False
3636, for by her predeceasing herdaughter the latter would have come into possession of theproperty and even had she only survived her mother by fiveminute her property would in case there were no will anda will wa a practical impossibility in such a case havebeen treated at her decease a under intestacy ,Dracula,False
3637, in whichcase lord godalming though so dear a friend would have hadno claim in the world ,Dracula,False
3638, and the inheritor being remote would not be likely to abandon their just right for senti mental reason regarding an entire stranger ,Dracula,False
3639, i assure you my dear sir i am rejoiced at the result perfectly rejoiced ,Dracula,False

3659,  i comforted him a well a i could ,Dracula,False
3660, in such case mendo not need much expression ,Dracula,False
3661, a grip of the hand the tight ening of an arm over the shoulder a sob in unison are ex pression of sympathy dear to a man heart ,Dracula,False
3662, i stood stilland silent till hi sob died away and then i said softly tohim come and look at her ,Dracula,False

4262, dr vincenttook the bandage from it throat and showed u the punct ure ,Dracula,False
4263, there wa no mistaking the similarity to those whichhad been on lucy throat ,Dracula,False
4264, they were smaller and the edgeslooked fresher that wa all ,Dracula,False
4265, we asked vincent to what heattributed them and he replied that it must have been abite of some animal perhap a rat but for hi own part hewa inclined to think it wa one of the bat which are sonumerou on the northern height of london ,Dracula,False
4266, out of so manyharml one he said there may be some wild specimenfrom the south of a more malignant specie ,Dracula,False
4267, some sailor mayhave brought one home and it managed to escape or even fromthe zoological garden a young one may have got loose or onebe bred there from a vampire ,Dracula,False
4268, these thing do occur you know ,Dracula,False
4269, only ten day ago a wolf got out and wa i believe traced up in thi direction ,Dracula,False
4270, for a week after the childrenwere playing nothing but red riding hood on the heath and inevery alley in the place until thi `bloofer lady scarecame along since then it ha been quite a gala time withthem ,Dracula,False
4271, even thi poor little mite when he woke up today asked the nurse if he might go away ,Dracula,False
4272, when she asked him whyhe wanted to go he said he wanted to play with the `blooferlady ,Dracula,False
4273,  i hope said van helsing that when you are sendingthe child home you will caution it parent to keep strictwatch over it ,Dracula,False
4274, these fancie to stray are most dangerou and if the child were to remain out another night it wouldprobably be fatal ,Dracula,False
4275, but in any case i suppose you will notlet it away for some days ,Dracula,False
4276,  certainly not not for a week at least longer if thewound i not healed ,Dracula,False
4277,  our visit to the hospital took more time than we hadreckoned on and the sun had dipped before we came out ,Dracula,False
4278, whenvan helsing saw how dark it wa he said there i not hurry ,Dracula,False
4279, it i more late than i thought ,Dracula,False
4280,come let u seek somewhere that we may eat and then weshall go on our way ,Dracula,False
4281,  we dined at `jack straw castle along with a littlecrowd of bicyclist and other who were genially noisy ,Dracula,False
4282,aboutten oclock we started from the inn ,Dracula,False
4283, it wa then very dark and the scattered lamp made the darkn greater when wewere once outside their individual radiu ,Dracula,False
4284, the professor hadevidently noted the road we were to go for he went on un hesitatingly but a for me i wa in quite a mixup a tolocality ,Dracula,False
4285, a we went further we met fewer and fewer people till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even thepatrol of horse police going their usual suburban round ,Dracula,False
4286, atlast we reached the wall of the churchyard which we climbedover ,Dracula,False
4287, with some little difficulty for it wa very dark andthe whole place seemed so strange to u we found the west enra tomb ,Dracula,False
4288, the professor took the key opened the creakydoor and standing back politely but quite unconsciously motioned me to precede him ,Dracula,False
4289, there wa a deliciou irony inthe offer in the courtlin of giving preference on such aghastly occasion ,Dracula,False
4290, my companion followed me quickly andcautiously drew the door to after carefully ascertainingthat the lock wa a falling and not a spring one ,Dracula,False
4291, in thelatter case we should have been in a bad plight ,Dracula,False
4292, then hefumbled in hi bag and taking out a matchbox and a piece ofcandle proceeded to make a light ,Dracula,False
4293, the tomb in the daytime and when wreathed with fresh flower had looked grim andgruesome enough but now some day afterward when theflower hung lank and dead their white turning to rust andtheir green to brown when the spider and the beetle hadresumed their accustomed dominance when the time discoloredstone and dust encrusted mortar and rusty dank iron andtarnished bras and clouded silver plating gave back thefeeble glimmer of a candle the effect wa more miserableand sordid than could have been imagined ,Dracula,False
4294, it conveyed irr esistibly the idea that life animal life wa not the onlything which could pas away ,Dracula,False
4295,  van helsing went about hi work systematically ,Dracula,False
4296, hold ing hi candle so that he could read the coffin plate andso holding it that the sperm dropped in white patche whichcongealed a they touched the metal he made assurance oflucy coffin ,Dracula,False
4297, another search in hi bag and he took out aturnscrew ,Dracula,False
4298,  what are you going to do ,Dracula,False
4299,  to open the coffin ,Dracula,False
4300, you shall yet be convinced ,Dracula,False
4301,  straightway he began taking out the screw and finallylifted off the lid showing the casing of lead beneath ,Dracula,False
4302, thesight wa almost too much for me ,Dracula,False
4303, it seemed to be a much anaffront to the dead a it would have been to have strippedoff her clothing in her sleep whilst living ,Dracula,False
4304, i actually tookhold of hi hand to stop him ,Dracula,False
4305,  he only said you shall see and again fumbling in hisbag took out a tiny fret saw ,Dracula,False
4306, striking the turnscrew throughthe lead with a swift downward stab which made me wince hemade a small hole which wa however big enough to admitthe point of the saw ,Dracula,False
4307, i had expected a rush of ga from theweek old corpse ,Dracula,False
4308, we doctor who have had to study our dan ger have to become accustomed to such thing and i drewback toward the door ,Dracula,False
4309, but the professor never stopped fora moment ,Dracula,False
4310, he sawed down a couple of feet along one side ofthe lead coffin and then acros and down the other side ,Dracula,False
4311,taking the edge of the loose flange he bent it back towardsthe foot of the coffin and holding up the candle into theaperture motioned to me to look ,Dracula,False
4312,  i drew near and looked ,Dracula,False
4313, it wascertainly a surprise to me and gave me a considerable shock but van helsing wa unmoved ,Dracula,False
4314, he wa now more sure than everof hi ground and so emboldened to proceed in hi task ,Dracula,False
4315,  i felt all the dogged argumentativen of my natureawake within me a i answered him i am satisfied thatlucy body i not in that coffin but that only prove onething ,Dracula,False
4316,  and what i that friend john ,Dracula,False
4317,  that it i not there ,Dracula,False
4318,  that i good logic he said so far a it goe ,Dracula,False
4319, buthow do you how can you account for it not being there ,Dracula,False
4320,  perhap a body snatcher i suggested ,Dracula,False
4321, some of theundertaker people may have stolen it ,Dracula,False
4322, i felt that i wasspeaking folly and yet it wa the only real cause which icould suggest ,Dracula,False
4323, he said we must havemore proof ,Dracula,False
4324,  he put on the coffin lid again gathered up all histhing and placed them in the bag blew out the light andplaced the candle also in the bag ,Dracula,False
4325, we opened the door andwent out ,Dracula,False
4326, behind u he closed the door and locked it ,Dracula,False
4327, hehanded me the key saying will you keep it ,Dracula,False
4328,  i laughed it wa not a very cheerful laugh i am boundto say a i motioned him to keep it ,Dracula,False
4329, a key i nothing isaid thee are many duplicate and anyhow it i not diffi cult to pick a lock of thi kind ,Dracula,False
4330,  he said nothing but put the key in hi pocket ,Dracula,False
4331, thenhe told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst hewould watch at the other ,Dracula,False
4332, i took up my place behind a yew tree and i saw hisdark figure move until the intervening headstone and treeshid it from my sight ,Dracula,False
4333, it wa a lonely vigil ,Dracula,False
4334, just after i had taken my place iheard a distant clock strike twelve and in time came one andtwo ,Dracula,False
4335,i wa chilled and unnerved and angry with the professorfor taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming ,Dracula,False
4336,i wa too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant and notsleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether i had adreary miserable time ,Dracula,False
4337,  suddenly a i turned round i thought i saw somethinglike a white streak moving between two dark yew tree at theside of the churchyard farthest from the tomb ,Dracula,False
4338, at the sametime a dark mas moved from the professor side of theground and hurriedly went toward it ,Dracula,False
4339, then i too moved buti had to go round headstone and railed off tomb and istumbled over grave ,Dracula,False
4340,the sky wa overcast and somewhere faroff an early cock crew ,Dracula,False
4341, a little way off beyond a line ofscattered juniper tree which marked the pathway to thechurch a white dim figure flitted in the direction of thetomb ,Dracula,False
4342, the tomb itself wa hidden by tree and i could notsee where the figure had disappeared ,Dracula,False
4343, i heard the rustle ofactual movement where i had first seen the white figure andcoming over found the professor holding in hi arm a tinychild ,Dracula,False
4344, when he saw me he held it out to me and said areyou satisfied now ,Dracula,False
4345,  no i said in a way that i felt wa aggressive ,Dracula,False
4346,  do you not see the child ,Dracula,False
4347,  ye it i a child but who brought it here ,Dracula,False
4348,  we shall see said the professor and with one impulsewe took our way out of the churchyard he carrying the sleep ing child ,Dracula,False
4349,  when we had got some little distance away we went intoa clump of tree and struck a match and looked at thechild throat ,Dracula,False
4350, it wa without a scratch or scar of any kind ,Dracula,False
4351,  we were just in time said the professor thankfully ,Dracula,False
4352,  we had now to decide what we were to do with the child and so consulted about it ,Dracula,False
4353, if we were to take it to a policestation we should have to give some account of our movementsduring the night ,Dracula,False
4354, at least we should have had to make somestatement a to how we had come to find the child ,Dracula,False
4355,so finallywe decided that we would take it to the heath and when weheard a policeman coming would leave it where he could notfail to find it ,Dracula,False
4356, we would then seek our way home a quicklya we could ,Dracula,False
4357, at the edge of hampsteadheath we heard a policeman heavy tramp and laying thechild on the pathway we waited and watched until he saw ita he flashed hi lantern to and fro ,Dracula,False
4358, we heard hi exclam ation of astonishment and then we went away silently ,Dracula,False
4359, bygood chance we got a cab near the `spainiard  and drove totown ,Dracula,False
4360,  i cannot sleep so i make thi entry ,Dracula,False
4361, but i must try toget a few hours sleep a van helsing i to call for me atnoon ,Dracula,False
4362, he insist that i go with him on another expedition ,Dracula,False
4363, it wa two oclock before we found asuitable opportunity for our attempt ,Dracula,False

4390,  i had no answer for thi so wa silent ,Dracula,False
4391, van helsingdid not seem to notice my silence ,Dracula,False
4392, at any rate he showedneither chagrin nor triumph ,Dracula,False
4393, he wa looking intently at theface of the dead woman raising the eyelid and looking atthe eye and once more opening the lip and examining theteeth ,Dracula,False

5263, it wa to be taken a gravely and in a businesslikea way a any other transaction of life ,Dracula,False

5389, so i contented myself with makinga general statement that he appeared to be improving veryrapidly that i would have a longer chat with him in themorning and would then see what i could do in the directionof meeting hi wishe ,Dracula,False
5390,  thi did not at all satisfy him for he said quickly but i fear dr ,Dracula,False

5429,  my expectation wa not realized for when he found thathi appeal would not be successful he got into quite a fran tic condition ,Dracula,False
5430,he threw himself on hi knee and held up hishand wringing them in plaintive supplication and pouredforth a torrent of entreaty with the tear rolling down hischeek and hi whole face and form expressive of the deepestemotion ,Dracula,False

5460, all isbest a they are ,Dracula,False
5461, seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kindof way i dont know but that i agree with you ,Dracula,False
5462, if thatman had been an ordinary lunatic i would have taken mychance of trusting him but he seem so mixed up with thecount in an indexy kind of way that i am afraid of doing any thing wrong by helping hi fad ,Dracula,False
5463,i cant forget how he prayedwith almost equal fervor for a cat and then tried to tear mythroat out with hi teeth ,Dracula,False
5464,beside he called the count `lordand master and he may want to get out to help him in somediabolical way ,Dracula,False
5465,that horrid thing ha the wolve and the ratsand hi own kind to help him so i suppose he isnt abovetrying to use a respectable lunatic ,Dracula,False

5473, he held up a little silver whistle a heremarked that old place may be full of rat and if so ive got an antidote on call ,Dracula,False
5474,  having passed the wall we took our way to the house taking care to keep in the shadow of the tree on the lawnwhen the moonlight shone out ,Dracula,False
5475, when we got to the porch theprofessor opened hi bag and took out a lot of thing whichhe laid on the step sorting them into four little group evidently one for each ,Dracula,False
5476,  my friend we are going into a terrible danger and weneed arm of many kind ,Dracula,False
5477, our enemy i not merely spiritual ,Dracula,False
5478,remember that he ha the strength of twenty men and that though our neck or our windpipe are of the common kind andtherefore breakable or crushable hi are not amenable tomere strength ,Dracula,False
5479, a stronger man or a body of men more strongin all than him can at certain time hold him but they can not hurt him a we can be hurt by him ,Dracula,False
5480, we must therefore guard ourselve from hi touch ,Dracula,False
5481, keep thi near your heart ,Dracula,False
5482,a he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held itout to me i being nearest to him put these flower roundyour neck here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlicblossom for other enemie more mundane thi revolver andthi knife and for aid in all these so small electric lamp which you can fasten to your breast and for all and aboveall at the last thi which we must not desecrate needl ,Dracula,False
5483,  thi wa a portion of sacred wafer which he put in anenvelope and handed to me ,Dracula,False

5488, pre sently he got one to suit after a little play back andforward the bolt yielded and with a rusty clang shot back ,Dracula,False
5489,we pressed on the door the rusty hinge creaked and itslowly opened ,Dracula,False
5490, it wa startlingly like the image conveyed tome in dr ,Dracula,False
5491, seward diary of the opening of mis westenrastomb i fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the other for with one accord they shrank back ,Dracula,False
5492, the professor wa thefirst to move forward and stepped into the open door ,Dracula,False
5493,  in manu tua domine ,Dracula,False
5494,he said crossing himself a hepassed over the threshold ,Dracula,False
5495,we closed the door behind u lestwhen we should have lit our lamp we should possibly attractattention from the road ,Dracula,False
5496, the professor carefully tried thelock lest we might not be able to open it from withinshould we be in a hurry making our exit ,Dracula,False
5497, then we all lit ourlamp and proceeded on our search ,Dracula,False
5498,  the light from the tiny lamp fell in all sort of oddform a the ray crossed each other or the opacity of ourbodie threw great shadow ,Dracula,False
5499, i could not for my life get awayfrom the feeling that there wa someone else amongst u ,Dracula,False
5500, isuppose it wa the recollection so powerfully brought hometo me by the grim surrounding of that terrible experiencein transylvania ,Dracula,False
5501, i think the feeling wa common to u all for i noticed that the other kept looking over theirshoulder at every sound and every new shadow just a i feltmyself doing ,Dracula,False
5502,  the whole place wa thick with dust ,Dracula,False
5503,the floor wa seem ingly inche deep except where there were recent footstep in which on holding down my lamp i could see mark of hob nail where the dust wa cracked ,Dracula,False
5504, the wall were fluffy andheavy with dust and in the corner were masse of spidersweb whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like oldtattered rag a the weight had torn them partly down ,Dracula,False
5505, on atable in the hall wa a great bunch of key with a time yellowed label on each ,Dracula,False
5506,they had been used several time foron the table were several similar rent in the blanket ofdust similar to that exposed when the professor lifted them ,Dracula,False
5507,  he turned to me and said you know thi place jonathan ,Dracula,False
5508,you have copied map of it and you know it at least morethan we do ,Dracula,False
5509, which i the way to the chapel ,Dracula,False
5510,  i had an idea of it direction though on my formervisit i had not been able to get admission to it so i ledthe way and after a few wrong turning found myself oppositea low arched oaken door ribbed with iron band ,Dracula,False
5511,  thi i the spot said the professor a he turned hislamp on a small map of the house copied from the file of myoriginal correspondence regarding the purchase ,Dracula,False
5512, with alittle trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened thedoor ,Dracula,False
5513, we were prepared for some unpleasantn for a wewere opening the door a faint malodorou air seemed to ex hale through the gap but none of u ever expected such anodor a we encountered ,Dracula,False
5514, none of the other had met thecount at all at close quarter and when i had seen him hewa either in the fasting stage of hi existence in hisroom or when he wa bloated with fresh blood in a ruinedbuilding open to the air but here the place wa small andclose and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul ,Dracula,False
5515,there wa an earthy smell a of some dry miasma which camethrough the fouler air ,Dracula,False
5516, but a to the odor itself how shalli describe it ,Dracula,False
5517, it wa not alone that it wa composed of allthe ill of mortality and with the pungent acrid smell ofblood but it seemed a though corruption had become itselfcorrupt ,Dracula,False
5518, it sicken me to think of it ,Dracula,False
5519, every breathexhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the placeand intensified it loathsomen ,Dracula,False
5520,  under ordinary circumstance such a stench would havebrought our enterprise to an end but thi wa no ordinarycase and the high and terrible purpose in which we were in volved gave u a strength which rose above merely physicalconsideration ,Dracula,False
5521, after the involuntary shrinking consequenton the first nauseou whiff we one and all set about ourwork a though that loathsome place were a garden of rose ,Dracula,False
5522,  we made an accurate examination of the place the pro fessor saying a we began the first thing i to see howmany of the boxe are left we must then examine every holeand corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue asto what ha become of the rest ,Dracula,False
5523,  a glance wa sufficient to show how many remained forthe great earth chest were bulky and there wa no mistakingthem ,Dracula,False
5524,  there were only twenty nine left out of the fifty ,Dracula,False
5525, oncei got a fright for seeing lord godalming suddenly turn andlook out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond ilooked too and for an instant my heart stood still ,Dracula,False
5526, some where looking out from the shadow i seemed to see the highlight of the count evil face the ridge of the nose thered eye the red lip the awful pallor ,Dracula,False
5527, it wa only for amoment for a lord godalming said i thought i saw a face but it wa only the shadow and resumed hi inquiry iturned my lamp in the direction and stepped into the passage ,Dracula,False
5528,there wa no sign of anyone and a there were no corner nodoor no aperture of any kind but only the solid wall ofthe passage there could be no hiding place even for him ,Dracula,False
5529, itook it that fear had helped imagination and said nothing ,Dracula,False
5530,  a few minute later i saw morri step suddenly backfrom a corner which he wa examining ,Dracula,False
5531, we all followed hismovement with our eye for undoubtedly some nervousn wasgrowing on u and we saw a whole mas of phosphorescence which twinkled like star ,Dracula,False
5532, we all instinctively drew back ,Dracula,False
5533,the whole place wa becoming alive with rat ,Dracula,False
5534,  for a moment or two we stood appalled all save lordgodalming who wa seemingly prepared for such an emergency ,Dracula,False
5535,rushing over to the great iron bound oaken door which dr ,Dracula,False
5536,seward had described from the outside and which i had seenmyself he turned the key in the lock drew the huge bolt and swung the door open ,Dracula,False
5537, then taking hi little silverwhistle from hi pocket he blew a low shrill call ,Dracula,False
5538, it wasanswered from behind dr ,Dracula,False
5539, seward house by the yelping ofdog and after about a minute three terrier came dashinground the corner of the house ,Dracula,False
5540, unconsciously we had allmoved toward the door and a we moved i noticed that thedust had been much disturbed ,Dracula,False
5541, the boxe which had been takenout had been brought thi way ,Dracula,False
5542, but even in the minute thathad elapsed the number of the rat had vastly increased ,Dracula,False
5543,theyseemed to swarm over the place all at once till the lamp light shining on their moving dark bodie and glittering baleful eye made the place look like a bank of earth setwith fireflie ,Dracula,False
5544, the dog dashed on but at the thresholdsuddenly stopped and snarled and then simultaneously liftingtheir nose began to howl in most lugubriou fashion ,Dracula,False
5545, therat were multiplying in thousand and we moved out ,Dracula,False
5546,  lord godalming lifted one of the dog and carrying himin placed him on the floor ,Dracula,False
5547,the instant hi feet touched theground he seemed to recover hi courage and rushed at hisnatural enemie ,Dracula,False
5548, they fled before him so fast that before hehad shaken the life out of a score the other dog who hadby now been lifted in the same manner had but small preyere the whole mas had vanished ,Dracula,False
5549,  with their going it seemed a if some evil presence haddeparted for the dog frisked about and barked merrily asthey made sudden dart at their prostrate foe and turnedthem over and over and tossed them in the air with viciousshake ,Dracula,False
5550, we all seemed to find our spirit rise ,Dracula,False
5551, whether itwa the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening ofthe chapel door or the relief which we experienced byfinding ourselve in the open i know not but most certainlythe shadow of dread seemed to slip from u like a robe andthe occasion of our coming lost something of it grim signi ficance though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution ,Dracula,False
5552,we closed the outer door and barred and locked it and bring ing the dog with u began our search of the house ,Dracula,False
5553, wefound nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary pro portion and all untouched save for my own footstep when ihad made my first visit ,Dracula,False
5554, never once did the dog exhibitany symptom of uneasin and even when we returned to thechapel they frisked about a though they had been rabbithunting in a summer wood ,Dracula,False
5555,  the morning wa quickening in the east when we emergedfrom the front ,Dracula,False
5556, van helsing had taken the key of thehall door from the bunch and locked the door in orthodoxfashion putting the key into hi pocket when he had done ,Dracula,False
5557,  so far he said our night ha been eminently suc cessful ,Dracula,False
5558, no harm ha come to u such a i feared might beand yet we have ascertained how many boxe are missing ,Dracula,False
5559, morethan all do i rejoice that thi our first and perhap ourmost difficult and dangerou step ha been accomplishedwithout the bringing thereinto our most sweet madam mina ortroubling her waking or sleeping thought with sight andsound and smell of horror which she might never forget ,Dracula,False

5565, and now let u go home ,Dracula,False
5566, the dawni close at hand and we have reason to be content with ourfirst night work ,Dracula,False
5567, it may be ordained that we have manynight and day to follow if full of peril but we must goon and from no danger shall we shrink ,Dracula,False
5568,  the house wa silent when we got back save for somepoor creature who wa screaming away in one of the distantward and a low moaning sound from renfield room ,Dracula,False
5569, thepoor wretch wa doubtl torturing himself after the mannerof the insane with needl thought of pain ,Dracula,False

5678, the gaslight which i had left lit for jonathan butturned down came only like a tiny red spark through the fog which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room ,Dracula,False
5679,then it occurred to me that i had shut the window before ihad come to bed ,Dracula,False
5680, i would have got out to make certain on thepoint but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limb andeven my will ,Dracula,False

8020, for had he power to move himself a he wished hecould go either a man or wolf or bat or in some otherway ,Dracula,False
8021, he evidently fear discovery or interference in thestate of helplessn in which he must be confined a he isbetween dawn and sunset in hi wooden box ,Dracula,False
8022,  (b) how i he to be taken ,Dracula,False
8023, here a proc of exclu sion may help u ,Dracula,False
8024, by road by rail by water ,Dracula,False
8025, there are endl difficultie especi ally in leaving the city ,Dracula,False
8026,  (x) there are people ,Dracula,False
8027, and people are curiou andinvestigate ,Dracula,False
8028, a hint a surmise a doubt a to what might bein the box would destroy him ,Dracula,False
8029,  (y) there are or there may be custom and octroiofficer to pas ,Dracula,False
8030,  (z) hi pursuer might follow ,Dracula,False
8031, and in order to prevent hi being betrayed he hasrepelled so far a he can even hi victim me ,Dracula,False
8032, there i no one in charge of the box ,Dracula,False
8033, itwould have to take it chance of being delayed and delaywould be fatal with enemie on the track ,Dracula,False
8034, true he mightescape at night ,Dracula,False
8035, but what would he be if left in a strangeplace with no refuge that he could fly to ,Dracula,False
8036, thi i not whathe intend and he doe not mean to risk it ,Dracula,False
8037, here i the safest way in one respect but with most danger in another ,Dracula,False
8038, on the water he i power l except at night ,Dracula,False
8039, even then he can only summon fog andstorm and snow and hi wolve ,Dracula,False
8040, but were he wrecked theliving water would engulf him helpl and he would indeedbe lost ,Dracula,False
8041, he could have the vessel drive to land but if itwere unfriendly land wherein he wa not free to move hisposition would still be desperate ,Dracula,False
8042,  we know from the record that he wa on the water sowhat we have to do i to ascertain what water ,Dracula,False
8043,  the first thing i to realize exactly what he ha donea yet ,Dracula,False
8044, we may then get a light on what hi task i to be ,Dracula,False
8045, we must differentiate between what he did inlondon a part of hi general plan of action when he waspressed for moment and had to arrange a best he could ,Dracula,False
8046,  secondly we must see a well a we can surmise it fromthe fact we know of what he ha done here ,Dracula,False
8047,  a to the first he evidently intended to arrive atgalatz and sent invoice to varna to deceive u lest weshould ascertain hi mean of exit from england ,Dracula,False
8048, hi immed iate and sole purpose then wa to escape ,Dracula,False
8049, the proof of thi i the letter of instruction sent ot immanuel hildesheim toclear and take away the box before sunrise ,Dracula,False
8050,there i also theinstruction to petrof skinsky ,Dracula,False
8051, these we must only gu at but there must have been some letter or message since skin sky came to hildesheim ,Dracula,False
8052,  that so far hi plan were successful we know ,Dracula,False
8053, theczarina catherine made a phenomenally quick journey ,Dracula,False
8054, so muchso that captain donelson suspicion were aroused ,Dracula,False
8055, but hissuperstition united with hi cannin played the countsgame for him and he ran with hi favoring wind through fogsand all till he brought up blindfold at galatz ,Dracula,False
8056, that thecount arrangement were well made ha been proved ,Dracula,False
8057,hilde sheim cleared the box took it off and gave it to skinsky ,Dracula,False
8058,skinsky took it and here we lose the trail ,Dracula,False
8059, we only knowthat the box i somewhere on the water moving along ,Dracula,False
8060, thecustom and the octroi if there be any have been avoided ,Dracula,False
8061,  now we come to what the count must have done after hisarrival on land at galatz ,Dracula,False
8062,  the box wa given to skinsky before sunrise ,Dracula,False
8063, at sun rise the count could appear in hi own form ,Dracula,False
8064, here we askwhy skinsky wa chosen at all to aid in the work ,Dracula,False
8065, in myhusband diary skinsky i mentioned a dealing with theslovak who trade down the river to the port ,Dracula,False
8066, and the mansremark that the murder wa the work of a slovak showed thegeneral feeling against hi clas ,Dracula,False
8067, the count wanted iso lation ,Dracula,False
8068,  my surmise i thi that in london the count decidedto get back to hi castle by water a the most safe andsecret way ,Dracula,False
8069, he wa brought from the castle by szgany andprobably they delivered their cargo to slovak who took theboxe to varna for there they were shipped to london ,Dracula,False
8070, thusthe count had knowledge of the person who could arrangethi service ,Dracula,False
8071, when the box wa on land before sunrise orafter sunset he came out from hi box met skinsky andinstructed him what to do a to arranging the carriage ofthe box up some river ,Dracula,False
8072, when thi wa done and he knew thatall wa in train he blotted out hi trace a he thought by murdering hi agent ,Dracula,False
8073,  i have examined the map and find that the river mostsuitable for the slovak to have ascended i either thepruth or the sereth ,Dracula,False
8074, i read in the typescript that in mytrance i heard cow low and water swirling level with myear and the creaking of wood ,Dracula,False
8075, the count in hi box then wa on a river in an open boat propelled probably eitherby oar or pole for the bank are near and it i workingagainst stream ,Dracula,False
8076, there would be no such if floating downstream ,Dracula,False
8077,  of course it may not be either the sereth or the pruth but we may possibly investigate further ,Dracula,False
8078, now of these two the pruth i the more easily navigated but the sereth i at fundu joined by the bistritza which run up round theborgo pas ,Dracula,False
8079, the loop it make i manifestly a close todracula castle a can be got by water ,Dracula,False
8080,  mina harker journal continued  when i had done reading jonathan took me in hi armsand kissed me ,Dracula,False
8081, the other kept shaking me by both hand and dr ,Dracula,False
8082, van helsing said our dear madam mina i once moreour teacher ,Dracula,False
8083, her eye have been where we were blinded ,Dracula,False
8084, nowwe are on the track once again and thi time we may succeed ,Dracula,False
8085,our enemy i at hi most helpl ,Dracula,False
8086, and if we can come on himby day on the water our task will be over ,Dracula,False
8087, he ha a start but he i powerl to hasten a he may not leave thi boxlest those who carry him may suspect ,Dracula,False
8088, for them to suspectwould be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where heperish ,Dracula,False
8089, thi he know and will not ,Dracula,False
8090, now men to our councilof war for here and now we must plan what each and allshall do ,Dracula,False
8091,  i shall get a steam launch and follow him said lordgodalming ,Dracula,False
8092,  and i horse to follow on the bank lest by chance heland said mr morri ,Dracula,False

8569, when we had gone about amile i wa tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest ,Dracula,False
8570,then we looked back and saw where the clear line of drac ula castle cut the sky ,Dracula,False
8571, for we were so deep under the hillwhereon it wa set that the angle of perspective of the car pathian mountain wa far below it ,Dracula,False
8572, we saw it in all itsgrandeur perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheerprecipice and with seemingly a great gap between it and thesteep of the adjacent mountain on any side ,Dracula,False
8573, there wa some thing wild and uncanny about the place ,Dracula,False

8606,  when he had completed it he stood beside me again say ing at least you shall be safe here from him ,Dracula,False
8607, he took theglasse from me and at the next lull of the snow swept thewhole space below u ,Dracula,False
8608, see he said they come quickly ,Dracula,False

8623, oneof them i knew wa jonathan and the other i took of course to be lord godalming ,Dracula,False
8624, they too were pursuing the party withthe cart ,Dracula,False
8625, when i told the professor he shouted in glee likea schoolboy and after looking intently till a snow fallmade sight impossible he laid hi winchester rifle ready foruse against the boulder at the opening of our shelter ,Dracula,False
8626,  they are all converging he said ,Dracula,False
8627,when the time comeswe shall have gypsie on all side ,Dracula,False
8628, i got out my revolverready to hand for whilst we were speaking the howling ofwolve came louder and closer ,Dracula,False
8629, when the snow storm abated amoment we looked again ,Dracula,False
8630, it wa strange to see the snow fall ing in such heavy flake close to u and beyond the sunshining more and more brightly a it sank down toward thefar mountain top ,Dracula,False
8631, sweeping the glas all around u i couldsee here and there dot moving singly and in two and threesand larger number ,Dracula,False

8635, at time we couldnot see an arm length before u ,Dracula,False
8636, but at other a thehollow sounding wind swept by u it seemed to clear the airspace around u so that we could see afar off ,Dracula,False
8637, we had oflate been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset thatwe knew with fair accuracy when it would be ,Dracula,False
8638,and we knew thatbefore long the sun would set ,Dracula,False
8639, it wa hard to believe thatby our watche it wa l than an hour that we waited inthat rocky shelter before the variou bodie began to con verge close upon u ,Dracula,False
8640, the wind came now with fiercer and morebitter sweep and more steadily from the north ,Dracula,False
8641,it seeminglyhad driven the snow cloud from u for with only occasionalburst the snow fell ,Dracula,False
8642, we could distinguish clearly theindividual of each party the pursued and the pursuer ,Dracula,False
8643,strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realize orat least to care that they were pursued ,Dracula,False
8644, they seemed how ever to hasten with redoubled speed a the sun dropped lowerand lower on the mountain top ,Dracula,False
8645,  closer and closer they drew ,Dracula,False
8646, the professor and i crouc hed down behind our rock and held our weapon ready ,Dracula,False
8647, icould see that he wa determined that they should not pas ,Dracula,False

0,thi book i largely concerned with hobbit and from it page a reader may discover much of their character and a little of their history ,LOTR1,False
1, further information will also be found in the selection from the red book of westmarch that ha already been published under the title of the hobbit ,LOTR1,False
2, that story wa derived from the earlier chapter of the red book composed by bilbo himself the first hobbit to become famou in the world at large and called by him there and back again since they told of hi journey into the east and hi return: an adventure which later involved all the hobbit in the great event of that age that are here related ,LOTR1,False
3, many however may wish to know more about thi remarkable people from the outset while some may not poss the earlier book ,LOTR1,False
4, for such reader a few note on the more important point are here collected from hobbit lore and the first adventure i briefly recalled ,LOTR1,False
5, hobbit are an unobtrusive but very ancient people more numerou formerly than they are today; for they love peace and quiet and good tilled earth: a well ordered and well farmed countryside wa their favourite haunt ,LOTR1,False
6, they do not and did not understand or like machine more complicated than a forge bellow a water mill or a hand loom though they were skilful with tool ,LOTR1,False
7, even in ancient day they were a a rule shy of the big folk a they call u and now they avoid u with dismay and are becoming hard to find ,LOTR1,False
8, they are quick of hearing and sharp eyed and though they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily they are nonethel nimble and deft in their movement ,LOTR1,False
9, they possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and silently when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come blundering by; and thi an they have developed until to men it may seem magical ,LOTR1,False
10, but hobbit have never in fact studied magic of any kind and their elusiven i due solely to a professional skill that heredity and practice and a close friendship with the earth have rendered inimitable by bigger and clumsier race ,LOTR1,False
11, for they are a little people smaller than dwarves: l tout and stocky that i even when they are not actually much shorter ,LOTR1,False
12, their height i variable ranging between two and four feet of our measure ,LOTR1,False
13, they seldom now reach three feet; but they hive dwindled they say and in ancient day they were taller ,LOTR1,False
14, according to the red book bandobra took (bullroarer) son of isengrim the second wa four foot five and able to ride a horse ,LOTR1,False
15, he wa surpassed in all hobbit record only by two famou character of old; but that curiou matter i dealt with in thi book ,LOTR1,False
16, a for the hobbit of the shire with whom these tale are concerned in the day of their peace and prosperity they were a merry folk ,LOTR1,False
17, they dressed in bright colour being notably fond of yellow and green; but they seldom wore shoe since their feet had tough leathery sole and were clad in a thick curling hair much like the hair of their head which wa commonly brown ,LOTR1,False
18, thu the only craft little practised among them wa shoe making; but they had long and skilful finger and could make many other useful and comely thing ,LOTR1,False
19, their face were a a rule good natured rather than beautiful broad bright eyed red cheeked with mouth apt to laughter and to eating and drinking ,LOTR1,False
20, and laugh they did and eat and drink often and heartily being fond of simple jest at all time and of six meal a day (when they could get them) ,LOTR1,False
21, they were hospitable and delighted in partie and in present which they gave away freely and eagerly accepted ,LOTR1,False
22, it i plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement hobbit are relative of ours: far nearer to u than elve or even than dwarve ,LOTR1,False
23, of old they spoke the language of men after their own fashion and liked and disliked much the same thing a men did ,LOTR1,False
24, but what exactly our relationship i can no longer be discovered ,LOTR1,False
25, the beginning of hobbit lie far back in the elder day that are now lost and forgotten ,LOTR1,False
26, only the elve still preserve any record of that vanished time and their tradition are concerned almost entirely with their own history in which men appear seldom and hobbit are not mentioned at all ,LOTR1,False
27, yet it i clear that hobbit had in fact lived quietly in middle earth for many long year before other folk became even aware of them ,LOTR1,False
28, and the world being after all full of strange creature beyond count these little people seemed of very little importance ,LOTR1,False
29, but in the day of bilbo and of frodo hi heir they suddenly became by no wish of their own both important and renowned and troubled the counsel of the wise and the great ,LOTR1,False
30, those day the third age of middle earth are now long past and the shape of all land ha been changed; but the region in which hobbit then lived were doubtl the same a those in which they still linger: the north west of the old world east of the sea ,LOTR1,False
31, of their original home the hobbit in bilbo time preserved no knowledge ,LOTR1,False
32, a love of learning (other than genealogical lore) wa far from general among them but there remained still a few in the older familie who studied their own book and even gathered report of old time and distant land from elve dwarve and men ,LOTR1,False
33, their own record began only after the settlement of the shire and their most ancient legend hardly looked further back than their wandering day ,LOTR1,False
34, it i clear nonethel from these legend and from the evidence of their peculiar word and custom that like many other folk hobbit had in the distant past moved westward ,LOTR1,False
35, their earliest tale seem to glimpse a time when they dwelt in the upper vale of anduin between the eave of greenwood the great and the misty mountain ,LOTR1,False
36, why they later undertook the hard and perilou crossing of the mountain into eriador i no longer certain ,LOTR1,False
37, their own account speak of the multiplying of men in the land and of a shadow that fell on the forest so that it became darkened and it new name wa mirkwood ,LOTR1,False
38, before the crossing of the mountain the hobbit had already become divided into three somewhat different breeds: harfoot stoor and fallohide ,LOTR1,False
39, the harfoot were browner of skin smaller and shorter and they were beardl and bootless; their hand and feet were neat and nimble; and they preferred highland and hillside ,LOTR1,False
40, the stoor were broader heavier in build; their feet and hand were larger and they preferred flat land and riverside ,LOTR1,False
41, the fallohide were fairer of skin and also of hair and they were taller and slimmer than the others; they were lover of tree and of woodland ,LOTR1,False
42, the harfoot had much to do with dwarve in ancient time and long lived in the foothill of the mountain ,LOTR1,False
43, they moved westward early and roamed over eriador a far a weathertop while the other were still in the wilderland ,LOTR1,False
44, they were the most normal and representative variety of hobbit and far the most numerou ,LOTR1,False
45, they were the most inclined to settle in one place and longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnel and hole ,LOTR1,False
46, the stoor lingered long by the bank of the great river anduin and were l shy of men ,LOTR1,False
47, they came west after the harfoot and followed the course of the loudwater southwards; and there many of them long dwelt between tharbad and the border of dunland before they moved north again ,LOTR1,False
48, the fallohide the least numerou were a northerly branch ,LOTR1,False
49, they were more friendly with elve than the other hobbit were and had more skill in language and song than in handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to tilling ,LOTR1,False
50, they crossed the mountain north of rivendell and came down the river hoarwell ,LOTR1,False
51, in eriador they soon mingled with the other kind that had preceded them but being somewhat bolder and more adventurou they were often found a leader or chieftain among clan of harfoot or stoor ,LOTR1,False
52, even in bilbo time the strong fallohidish strain could still be noted among the greater familie such a the took and the master of buckland ,LOTR1,False
53, in the westland of eriador between the misty mountain and the mountain of lune the hobbit found both men and elve ,LOTR1,False
54, indeed a remnant still dwelt there of the dnedain the king of men that came over the sea out of westernesse; but they were dwindling fast and the land of their north kingdom were falling far and wide into waste ,LOTR1,False
55, there wa room and to spare for incomer and ere long the hobbit began to settle in ordered communitie ,LOTR1,False
56, most of their earlier settlement had long disappeared and been forgotten in bilbo time; but one of the first to become important still endured though reduced in size; thi wa at bree and in the chetwood that lay round about some forty mile east of the shire ,LOTR1,False
57, it wa in these early day doubtl that the hobbit learned their letter and began to write after the manner of the dnedain who had in their turn long before learned the art from the elve ,LOTR1,False
58, and in those day also they forgot whatever language they had used before and spoke ever after the common speech the westron a it wa named that wa current through all the land of the king from arnor to gondor and about all the coast of the sea from b elf ala to lune ,LOTR1,False
59, yet they kept a few word of their own a well a their own name of month and day and a great store of personal name out of the past ,LOTR1,False
60, about thi time legend among the hobbit first become history with a reckoning of year ,LOTR1,False
61, for it wa in the one thousand six hundred and first year of the third age that the fallohide brother marcho and blanco set out from bree; and having obtained permission from the high king at fornostl they crossed the brown river baranduin with a great following of hobbit ,LOTR1,False
62, they passed over the bridge of stonebow that had been built in the day of the power of the north kingdom and they took ail the land beyond to dwell in between the river and the far down ,LOTR1,False
63, all that wa demanded of them wa that they should keep the great bridge in repair and all other bridge and road speed the king messenger and acknowledge hi lordship ,LOTR1,False
64, thu began the shire reckoning for the year of the crossing of the brandywine (a the hobbit turned the name) became year one of the shire and all later date were reckoned from it ,LOTR1,False
65, number at once the western hobbit fell in love with their new land and they remained there and soon passed once more out of the history of men and of elve ,LOTR1,False
66, while there wa still a king they were in name hi subject but they were in fact ruled by their own chieftain and meddled not at all with event in the world outside ,LOTR1,False
67, to the last battle at fornost with the witch lord of angmar they sent some bowmen to the aid of the king or so they maintained though no tale of men record it ,LOTR1,False
68, but in that war the north kingdom ended; and then the hobbit took the land for their own and they chose from their own chief a thain to hold the authority of the king that wa gone ,LOTR1,False
69, there for a thousand year they were little troubled by war and they prospered and multiplied after the dark plague ( ,LOTR1,False
70, number) until the disaster of the long winter and the famine that followed it ,LOTR1,False
71, many thousand then perished but the day of dearth (number number) were at the time of thi tale long past and the hobbit had again become accustomed to plenty ,LOTR1,False
72, the land wa rich and kindly and though it had long been deserted when they entered it it had before been well tilled and there the king had once had many farm cornland vineyard and wood ,LOTR1,False
73, forty league it stretched from the far down to the brandywine bridge and fifty from the northern moor to the marshe in the south ,LOTR1,False
74, the hobbit named it the shire a the region of the authority of their thain and a district of well ordered business; and there in that pleasant comer of the world they plied their well ordered busin of living and they heeded l and l the world outside where dark thing moved until they came to think that peace and plenty were the rule in middle earth and the right of all sensible folk ,LOTR1,False
75, they forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the guardian and of the labour of those that made possible the long peace of the shire ,LOTR1,False
76, they were in fact sheltered but they had ceased to remember it ,LOTR1,False
77, at no time had hobbit of any kind been warlike and they had never fought among themselve ,LOTR1,False
78, in olden day they had of course been often obliged to fight to maintain themselve in a hard world; but in bilbo time that wa very ancient history ,LOTR1,False
79, the last battle before thi story open and indeed the only one that had ever been fought within the border of the shire wa beyond living memory: the battle of greenfield ,LOTR1,False
80, number in which bandobra took routed an invasion of ore ,LOTR1,False
81, even the weather had grown milder and the wolve that had once come ravening out of the north in bitter white winter were now only a grandfather tale ,LOTR1,False
82, so though there wa still some store of weapon in the shire these were used mostly a trophie hanging above hearth or on wall or gathered into the museum at michel delving ,LOTR1,False
83, the mathom house it wa called; for anything that hobbit had no immediate use for but were unwilling to throw away they called a mathom ,LOTR1,False
84, their dwelling were apt to become rather crowded with mathom and many of the present that passed from hand to hand were of that son ,LOTR1,False
85, nonethel ease and peace had left thi people still curiously tough ,LOTR1,False
86, they were if it came to it difficult to daunt or to kill; and they were perhap so unwearyingly fond of good thing not least because they could when put to it do without them and could survive rough handling by grief foe or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well and looked no further than their bellie and their well fed face ,LOTR1,False
87, though slow to quarrel and for sport killing nothing that lived they were doughty at bay and at need could still handle arm they shot well with the bow for they were keen eyed and sure at the mark ,LOTR1,False
88, not only with bow and arrow ,LOTR1,False
89, if any hobbit stooped for a stone it wa well to get quickly under cover a all trespassing beast knew very well ,LOTR1,False
90, all hobbit had originally lived in hole in the ground or so they believed and in such dwelling they still felt most at home; but in the course of time they had been obliged to adopt other form of abode ,LOTR1,False
91, actually in the shire in bilbo day it wa a a rule only the richest and the poorest hobbit that maintained the old custom ,LOTR1,False
92, the poorest went on living in burrow of the most primitive kind mere hole indeed with only one window or none; while the well to do still constructed more luxuriou version of the simple digging of old ,LOTR1,False
93, but suitable site for these large and ramifying tunnel (or smicil a they called them) were not everywhere to be found; and in the flat and the low lying district the hobbit a they multiplied began to build above ground ,LOTR1,False
94, indeed even in the hilly region and the older village such a hobbiton or tuckborough or in the chief township of the shire michel delving on the white down there were now many house of wood brick or stone ,LOTR1,False
95, these were specially favoured by miller smith roper and cartwright and other of that sort; for even when they had hole to live in ,LOTR1,False
96, hobbit had long been accustomed to build shed and workshop ,LOTR1,False
97, the habit of building farmhouse and barn wa said to have begun among the inhabitant of the marish down by the brandywine ,LOTR1,False
98, the hobbit of that quarter the eastfarthing were rather large and heavy legged and they wore dwarf boot in muddy weather ,LOTR1,False
99, but they were well known to be stoor in a large part of their blood a indeed wa shown by the down that many grew on their chin ,LOTR1,False
100, no harfoot or fallohide had any trace of a beard ,LOTR1,False
101, indeed the folk of the marish and of buckland east of the river which they afterward occupied came for the most part later into the shire up from south away; and they still had many peculiar name and strange word not found elsewhere in the shire ,LOTR1,False
102, it i probable that the craft of building a many other craft beside wa derived from the dnedain ,LOTR1,False
103, but the hobbit may have learned it direct from the elve the teacher of men in their youth ,LOTR1,False
104, for the elve of the high kindred had not yet forsaken middle earth and they dwelt still at that time at the grey haven away to the west and in other place within reach of the shire ,LOTR1,False
105, three elf tower of immemorial age were still to be seen on the tower hill beyond the western marche ,LOTR1,False
106, they shone far off in the moonlight ,LOTR1,False
107, the tallest wa furthest away standing alone upon a green mound ,LOTR1,False
108, the hobbit of the westfarthing said that one could see the sea from the lop of that tower; but no hobbit had ever been known to climb it ,LOTR1,False
109, indeed few hobbit had ever seen or sailed upon the sea and fewer still had ever returned to report it ,LOTR1,False
110, most hobbit regarded even river and small boat with deep misgiving and not many of them could swim ,LOTR1,False
111, and a the day of the shire lengthened they spoke l and l with the elve and grew afraid of them and distrustful of those that had dealing with them; and the sea became a word of fear among them and a token of death and they turned their face away from the hill in the west ,LOTR1,False
112, the craft of building may have come from elve or men but the hobbit used it in their own fashion ,LOTR1,False
113, they did not go in for tower ,LOTR1,False
114, their house were usually long low and comfortable ,LOTR1,False
115, the oldest kind were indeed no more than built imitation of smial thatched with dry gras or straw or roofed with turve and having wall somewhat bulged ,LOTR1,False
116, that stage however belonged to the early day of the shire and hobbit building had long since been altered improved by device learned from dwarve or discovered by themselve ,LOTR1,False
117, a preference for round window and even round door wa the chief remaining peculiarity of hobbit architecture ,LOTR1,False
118, the house and the hole of shire hobbit were often large and inhabited by large familie ,LOTR1,False
119, (bilbo and frodo baggin were a bachelor very exceptional a they were also in many other way such a their friendship with the elve ,LOTR1,False
120,) sometime a in the case of the took of great smial or the brandybuck of brandy hall many generation of relative lived in (comparative) peace together in one ancestral and many tunnelled mansion ,LOTR1,False
121, all hobbit were in any case clannish and reckoned up their relationship with great care ,LOTR1,False
122, they drew long and elaborate family tree with innumerable branche ,LOTR1,False
123, in dealing with hobbit it i important to remember who i related to whom and in what degree ,LOTR1,False
124, it would be impossible in thi book to set out a family tree that included even the more important member of the more important familie at the time which these tale tell of ,LOTR1,False
125, the genealogical tree at the end of the red book of westmarch are a small book in themselve and all but hobbit would find them exceedingly dull ,LOTR1,False
126, hobbit delighted in such thing if they were accurate: they liked to have book filled with thing that they already knew set out fair and square with no contradiction ,LOTR1,False
127, concerning pipe weed there i another astonishing thing about hobbit of old that must be mentioned an astonishing habit: they imbibed or inhaled through pipe of clay or wood the smoke of the burning leave of a herb which they called pipe weed or leaf a variety probably of nicotiana ,LOTR1,False
128, a great deal of mystery surround the origin of thi peculiar custom or art a the hobbit preferred to call it ,LOTR1,False
129, all that could be discovered about it in antiquity wa put together by meriadoc brandybuck (later master of buckland) and since he and the tobacco of the southfarthing play a part in the history that follow hi remark in the introduction to hi herblore of the shire may be quoted ,LOTR1,False
130, thi  he say i the one art that we can certainly claim to be our own invention ,LOTR1,False
131, when hobbit first began to smoke i not known all the legend and family historie take it for granted; for age folk in the shire smoked variou herb some fouler some sweeter ,LOTR1,False
132, but all account agree that tobold hornblower of longbottom in the southfarthing first grew the true pipe weed in hi garden in the day of isengrim the second about the year number of shire reckoning ,LOTR1,False
133, the best home grown still come from that district especially the varietie now known a longbottom leaf old toby and southern star ,LOTR1,False
134, how old toby came by the plant i not recorded for to hi dying day he would not tell ,LOTR1,False
135, he knew much about herb but he wa no traveller ,LOTR1,False
136, it i said that in hi youth he went often to bree though he certainly never went further from the shire than that ,LOTR1,False
137, it i thu quite possible that he learned of thi plant in bree where now at any rate it grow well on the south slope of the hill ,LOTR1,False
138, the bree hobbit claim to have been the first actual smoker of the pipe weed ,LOTR1,False
139, they claim of course to have done everything before the people of the shire whom they refer to a colonists; but in thi case their claim i i think likely to be true ,LOTR1,False
140, and certainly it wa from bree that the art of smoking the genuine weed spread in the recent centurie among dwarve and such other folk ranger wizard or wanderer a still passed to and fro through that ancient road meeting ,LOTR1,False
141, the home and centre of the an i thu to be found in the old inn of bree the prancing pony that ha been kept by the family of butterbur from time beyond record ,LOTR1,False
142, all the same observation that i have made on my own many journey south have convinced me that the weed itself i not native to our part of the world but came northward from the lower anduin whither it wa i suspect originally brought over sea by the men of westernesse ,LOTR1,False
143, it grow abundantly in gondor and there i richer and larger than in the north where it i never found wild and flourishe only in warm sheltered place like longbottom ,LOTR1,False
144, the men of gondor call it sweet galena and esteem it only for the fragrance of it flower ,LOTR1,False
145, from that land it must have been carried up the greenway during the long centurie between the coming of elendil and our own day ,LOTR1,False
146, but even the dnedain of gondor allow u thi credit: hobbit first put it into pipe ,LOTR1,False
147, not even the wizard first thought of that before we did ,LOTR1,False
148, though one wizard that i knew took up the art long ago and became a skilful in it a in all other thing that he put hi mind to ,LOTR1,False
149, of the ordering of the shire the shire wa divided into four quarter the farthing already referred to ,LOTR1,False
150, north south east and west; and these again each into a number of folkland which still bore the name of some of the old leading familie although by the time of thi history these name were no longer found only in their proper folkland ,LOTR1,False
151, nearly all took still lived in the tookland but that wa not true of many other familie such a the bagginse or the boffin ,LOTR1,False
152, outside the farthing were the east and west marches: the buckland (see beginning of chapter v book i); and the westmarch added to the shire in ,LOTR1,False
153, the shire at thi time had hardly any government ,LOTR1,False
154, familie for the most part managed their own affair ,LOTR1,False
155, growing food and eating it occupied most of their time ,LOTR1,False
156, in other matter they were a a rule generou and not greedy but contented and moderate so that estate farm workshop and small trade tended to remain unchanged for generation ,LOTR1,False
157, there remained of course the ancient tradition concerning the high king at fornost or norbury a they called it away north of the shire ,LOTR1,False
158, but there had been no king for nearly a thousand year and even the ruin of kings norbury were covered with gras ,LOTR1,False
159, yet the hobbit still said of wild folk and wicked thing (such a trolls) that they had not heard of the king ,LOTR1,False
160, for they attributed to the king of old all their essential laws; and usually they kept the law of free will because they were the rule (a they said) both ancient and just ,LOTR1,False
161, it i true that the took family had long been pre eminent; for the office of thain had passed to them (from the oldbucks) some centurie before and the chief took had borne that title ever since ,LOTR1,False
162, the thain wa the master of the shire moot and captain of the shire muster and the hobbitry in arm but a muster and moot were only held in time of emergency which no longer occurred the thainship had ceased to be more than a nominal dignity ,LOTR1,False
163, the took family wa still indeed accorded a special respect for it remained both numerou and exceedingly wealthy and wa liable to produce in every generation strong character of peculiar habit and even adventurou temperament ,LOTR1,False
164, the latter qualitie however were now rather tolerated (in the rich) than generally approved ,LOTR1,False
165, the custom endured nonethel of referring to the head of the family a the took and of adding to hi name if required a number: such a isengrim the second for instance ,LOTR1,False
166, the only real official in the shire at thi date wa the mayor of michel delving (or of the shire) who wa elected every seven year at the free fair on the white down at the lithe that i at midsummer ,LOTR1,False
167, a mayor almost hi only duty wa to preside at banquet given on the shire holiday which occurred at frequent interval ,LOTR1,False
168, but the office of postmaster and first shirriff were attached to the mayoralty so that he managed both the messenger service and the watch ,LOTR1,False
169, these were the only shire service and the messenger were the most numerou and much the busier of the two ,LOTR1,False
170, by no mean all hobbit were lettered but those who were wrote constantly to all their friend (and a selection of their relations) who lived further off than an afternoon walk ,LOTR1,False
171, the shirriff wa the name that the hobbit gave to their police or the nearest equivalent that they possessed ,LOTR1,False
172, they had of course no uniform (such thing being quite unknown) only a feather in their caps; and they were in practice rather hayward than policemen more concerned with the straying of beast than of people ,LOTR1,False
173, there were in all the shire only twelve of them three in each farthing for inside work ,LOTR1,False
174, a rather larger body varying at need wa employed to beat the bounds and to see that outsider of any kind great or small did not make themselve a nuisance ,LOTR1,False
175, at the time when thi story begin the bounder a they were called had been greatly increased ,LOTR1,False
176, there were many report and complaint of strange person and creature prowling about the border or over them: the first sign that all wa not quite a it should be and alway had been except in tale and legend of long ago ,LOTR1,False
177, few heeded the sign and not even bilbo yet had any notion of what it portended ,LOTR1,False
178, sixty year had passed since he set out on hi memorable journey and he wa old even for hobbit who reached a hundred a often a not; but much evidently still remained of the considerable wealth that he had brought back ,LOTR1,False
179, how much or how little he revealed to no one not even to frodo hi favourite nephew ,LOTR1,False
180, and he still kept secret the ring that he bad found ,LOTR1,False
181, of the finding of the ring a i told in the hobbit there came one day to bilbo door the great wizard gandalf the grey and thirteen dwarve with him: none other indeed than thorin oakenshield descendant of king and hi twelve companion in exile ,LOTR1,False
182, with them he set out to hi own lasting astonishment on a morning of april it being then the year number shire reckoning on a quest of great treasure the dwarf hoard of the king under the mountain beneath erebor in dale far off in the east ,LOTR1,False
183, the quest wa successful and the dragon that guarded the hoard wa destroyed ,LOTR1,False
184, yet though before all wa won the battle of five armie wa fought and thorin wa slain and many deed of renown were done the matter would scarcely have concerned later history or earned more than a note in the long annal of the third age but for an accident by the way ,LOTR1,False
185, the party wa assailed by ore in a high pas of the misty mountain a they went toward wilderland; and so it happened that bilbo wa lost for a while in the black ore mine deep under the mountain and there a he groped in vain in the dark he put hi hand on a ring lying on the floor of a tunnel ,LOTR1,False
186, ele put it in hi pocket ,LOTR1,False
187, it seemed then like mere luck ,LOTR1,False
188, trying to find hi way out ,LOTR1,False
189, bilbo went on down to the root of the mountain until he could go no further ,LOTR1,False
190, at the bottom of the tunnel lay a cold lake far from the light and on an island of rock in the water lived gollum ,LOTR1,False
191, he wa a loathsome little creature: he paddled a small boat with hi large flat feet peering with pale luminou eye and catching blind fish with hi long finger and eating them raw ,LOTR1,False
192, he ate any living thing even ore if he could catch it and strangle it without a struggle ,LOTR1,False
193, he possessed a secret treasure that had come to him long age ago when he still lived in the light: a ring of gold that made it wearer invisible ,LOTR1,False
194, it wa the one thing he loved hi precious and he talked to it even when it wa not with him ,LOTR1,False
195, for he kept it hidden safe in a hole on hi island except when he wa hunting or spying on the ore of the mine ,LOTR1,False
196, maybe he would have attacked bilbo at once if the ring had been on him when they met; but it wa not and the hobbit held in hi hand an elvish knife which served him a a sword ,LOTR1,False
197, so to gain time gollum challenged bilbo to the riddle game saying that if he asked a riddle which bilbo could not gu then he would kill him and eat him; but if bilbo defeated him then he would do a bilbo wished: he would lead him to a way out of the tunnel ,LOTR1,False
198, since he wa lost in the dark without hope and could neither go on nor back ,LOTR1,False
199, bilbo accepted the challenge; and they asked one another many riddle ,LOTR1,False
200, in the end bilbo won the game more by luck (a it seemed) than by wits; for he wa stumped at last for a riddle to ask and cried out a hi hand came upon the ring he lad picked up and forgotten: what haw i got in my pocket ,LOTR1,False
201, thi gollum failed to answer though he demanded three guesse ,LOTR1,False
202, the authoritie it i true differ whether thi last question wa a mere question and not a riddle according to the strict rule of the game; but all agree that after accepting it and trying to gu the answer gollum wa bound by hi promise ,LOTR1,False
203, and bilbo pressed him to keep hi word; for the thought came to him that thi slimy creature might prove false even though such promise were held sacred and of old all but the wickedest thing feared to break them ,LOTR1,False
204, but after age alone in the dark gollum heart wa black and treachery wa in it ,LOTR1,False
205, he slipped away and returned to the island of which bilbo knew nothing not far off in the dark water ,LOTR1,False
206, there he thought lay hi ring ,LOTR1,False
207, he wa hungry now and angry and once hi precious wa with him he would not fear any weapon at all ,LOTR1,False
208, but the ring wa not on the island; he had lost it it wa gone ,LOTR1,False
209, hi screech sent a shiver down bilbo back though he did not yet understand what had happened ,LOTR1,False
210, but gollum had at last leaped to a gu too late ,LOTR1,False
211, what ha it got in it pocketses ,LOTR1,False
212, the light in hi eye wa like a green flame a he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover hi precious ,LOTR1,False
213, just in time bilbo saw hi peril and he fled blindly up the passage away from the water; and once more he wa saved by hi luck ,LOTR1,False
214, for just a he ran he put hi hand in hi pocket and the ring slipped quietly on to hi finger ,LOTR1,False
215, so it wa that gollum passed him without seeing him and went to guard the way out lest the thief should escape ,LOTR1,False
216, warily bilbo followed him a he went along cursing and talking to himself about hi precious; from which talk at last even bilbo guessed the truth and hope came to him in the darkness: he himself had found the marvellou ring and a chance of escape from the ore and from gollum ,LOTR1,False
217, at length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the lower gate of the mine on the eastward side of the mountain ,LOTR1,False
218, there gollum crouched at bay smelling and listening; and bilbo wa tempted to slay him with hi sword ,LOTR1,False
219, but pity stayed him and though he kept the ring in which hi only hope lay he would not use it to help him kill the wretched creature at a disadvantage ,LOTR1,False
220, in the end gathering hi courage he leaped over gollum in the dark and fled away down the passage pursued by hi enemy crie of hate and despair: thief thief ,LOTR1,False
221, we hate it for ever ,LOTR1,False
222, now it i a curiou fact that thi i not the story a bilbo first told it to hi companion ,LOTR1,False
223, to them hi account wa that gollum had promised to give him a present if he won the game; but when gollum went to fetch it from hi island he found the treasure wa gone: a magic ring which had been given to him long ago on hi birthday ,LOTR1,False
224, bilbo guessed that thi wa the very ring that he had found and a he had won the game it wa already hi by right ,LOTR1,False
225, but being in a tight place he said nothing about it and made gollum show him the way out a a reward instead of a present ,LOTR1,False
226, thi account bilbo set down in hi memoir and he seem never to have altered it himself not even after the council of elrond ,LOTR1,False
227, evidently it still appeared in the original red book a it did in several of the copie and abstract ,LOTR1,False
228, but many copie contain the true account (a an alternative) derived no doubt from note by frodo or samwise both of whom learned the truth though they seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually written by the old hobbit himself ,LOTR1,False
229, gandalf however disbelieved bilbo first story a soon a he heard it and he continued to be very curiou about the ring ,LOTR1,False
230, eventually he got the true tale out of bilbo after much questioning which for a while strained their friendship; but the wizard seemed to think the truth important ,LOTR1,False
231, though he did not say so to bilbo he also thought it important and disturbing to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the first: quite contrary to hi habit ,LOTR1,False
232, the idea of a present wa not mere hobbitlike invention all the same ,LOTR1,False
233, it wa suggested to bilbo a he confessed by gollum talk that he overheard; for gollum did in fact call the ring hi birthday present many time ,LOTR1,False
234, that also gandalf thought strange and suspicious; but he did not discover the truth in thi point for many more year a will be seen in thi book ,LOTR1,False
235, of bilbo later adventure little more need be said here ,LOTR1,False
236, with the help of the ring he escaped from the ore guard at the gate and rejoined hi companion ,LOTR1,False
237, he used the ring many time on hi quest chiefly for the help of hi friends; but he kept it secret from them a long a he could ,LOTR1,False
238, after hi return to hi home he never spoke of it again to anyone save gandalf and frodo; and no one else in the shire knew of it existence or so he believed ,LOTR1,False
239, only to frodo did he show the account of hi journey that he wa writing ,LOTR1,False
240, hi sword sting bilbo hung over hi fireplace and hi coat of marvellou mail the gift of the dwarve from the dragon hoard he lent to a museum to the michel delving mathom house in fact ,LOTR1,False
241, but he kept in a drawer at bag end the old cloak and hood that he had worn on hi travels; and the ring secured by a fine chain remained in hi pocket ,LOTR1,False
242, he returned to hi home at bag end on june the numbernd in hi fifty second year ( ,LOTR1,False
243, number) and nothing very notable occurred in the shire until mr baggin began the preparation for the celebration of hi hundred and eleventh birthday ( ,LOTR1,False
244, at thi point thi history begin ,LOTR1,False
245, note on the shire record at the end of the third age the part played by the hobbit in the great event that led to the inclusion of the shire in the reunited kingdom awakened among them a more widespread interest in their own history; and many of their tradition up to that time still mainly oral were collected and written down ,LOTR1,False
246, the greater familie were also concerned with event in the kingdom at large and many of their member studied it ancient historie and legend ,LOTR1,False
247, by the end of the first century of the fourth age there were already to be found in the shire several librarie that contained many historical book and record ,LOTR1,False
248, the largest of these collection were probably at undertower at great smial and at brandy hall ,LOTR1,False
249, thi account of the end of the third age i drawn mainly from the red book of westmarch ,LOTR1,False
250, that most important source for the history of the war of the ring wa so called because it wa long preserved at undertower the home of the fairbairn warden of the westmarch ,LOTR1,False
251, number it wa in origin bilbo private diary which he took with him to rivendell ,LOTR1,False
252, frodo brought it back to the shire together with many loose leave of note and during ,LOTR1,False
253, number number he nearly filled it page with hi account of the war ,LOTR1,False
254, but annexed to it and preserved with it probably m a single red case were the three large volume bound in red leather that bilbo gave to him a a parting gift ,LOTR1,False
255, to these four volume there wa added in westmarch a fifth containing commentarie genealogie and variou other matter concerning the hobbit member of the fellowship ,LOTR1,False
256, the original red book ha not been preserved but many copie were made especially of the first volume for the use of the descendant of the children of master samwise ,LOTR1,False
257, the most important copy however ha a different history ,LOTR1,False
258, it wa kept at great smial but it wa written in condor probably at the request of the great grandson of peregrin and completed in ,LOTR1,False
259, it southern scribe appended thi note: findegil king writer finished thi work in iv number ,LOTR1,False
260, it i an exact copy in all detail of the thain book m mina tirith ,LOTR1,False
261, that book wa a copy made at the request of king elessar of the red book of the periannath and wa brought to him by the thain peregrin when he retired to gondor in iv number ,LOTR1,False
262, the thain book wa thu the first copy made of the red book and contained much that wa later omitted or lost ,LOTR1,False
263, in mina tirith it received much annotation and many correction especially of name word and quotation in the elvish languages; and there wa added to it an abbreviated version of those part of the tale of aragorn and arwen which lie outside the account of the war ,LOTR1,False
264, the full tale i stated to have been written by barahir grandson of the steward faramir some time after the passing of the king ,LOTR1,False
265, but the chief importance of findegil copy i that it alone contain the whole of bilbo translation from the elvish ,LOTR1,False
266, these three volume were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which between number and number he had used all the source available to him in rivendell both living and written ,LOTR1,False
267, but since they were little used by frodo being almost entirely concerned with the elder day no more i said of them here ,LOTR1,False
268, since meriadoc and peregrin became the head of their great familie and at the same time kept up their connexion with rohan and gondor the librarie at bucklebury and tuckborough contained much that did not appear in the red book ,LOTR1,False
269, in brandy hall there were many work dealing with eriador and the history of rohan ,LOTR1,False
270, some of these were composed or begun by meriadoc himself though in the shire he wa chiefly remembered for hi herhlore of the shire and for hi reckoning of year m which he discussed the relation of the calendar of the shire and bree to those of rivendell gondor and rohan ,LOTR1,False
271, he also wrote a short treatise on old word and name in the shire having special interest in discovering the kinship with the language of the rohirrim of such shire words a mathom and old element in place name ,LOTR1,False
272, at great smial the book were of l interest to shire folk though more important for larger history ,LOTR1,False
273, none of them wa written by peregrin but he and hi successor collected many manuscript written by scribe of gondor: mainly copie or summarie of historie or legend relating to elendil and hi heir ,LOTR1,False
274, only here in the shire were to be found extensive material for the history of nmenor and the arising of sauron ,LOTR1,False
275, it wa probably at great smial that the tale of year number wa put together with the assistance of material collected by meriadoc ,LOTR1,False
276, though the date given are often conjectural especially for the second age they deserve attention ,LOTR1,False
277, it i probable that meriadoc obtained assistance and information from rivendell which he visited more than once ,LOTR1,False
278, there though elrond had departed hi son long remained together with some of the high elven folk ,LOTR1,False
279, it i said that celeborn went to dwell there after the departure of galadriel; but there i no record of the day when at last he sought the grey haven and with him went the last living memory of the elder day in middle earth ,LOTR1,False
280, * book i * chapter number ,LOTR1,False
281, a long expected party when mr bilbo baggin of bag end announced that he would shortly be celebrating hi eleventy first birthday with a party of special magnificence there wa much talk and excitement in hobbiton ,LOTR1,False
282, bilbo wa very rich and very peculiar and had been the wonder of the shire for sixty year ever since hi remarkable disappearance and unexpected return ,LOTR1,False
283, the riche he had brought back from hi travel had now become a local legend and it wa popularly believed whatever the old folk might say that the hill at bag end wa full of tunnel stuffed with treasure ,LOTR1,False
284, and if that wa not enough for fame there wa also hi prolonged vigour to marvel at ,LOTR1,False
285, time wore on but it seemed to have little effect on mr baggin ,LOTR1,False
286, at ninety he wa much the same a at fifty ,LOTR1,False
287, at ninety nine they began to call him we// preserved but unchanged would have been nearer the mark ,LOTR1,False
288, there were some that shook their head and thought thi wa too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should poss (apparently) perpetual youth a well a (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth ,LOTR1,False
289, it will have to be paid for  they said ,LOTR1,False
290, it isnt natural and trouble will come of it ,LOTR1,False
291, but so far trouble had not come; and a mr baggin wa generou with hi money most people were willing to forgive him hi odditie and hi good fortune ,LOTR1,False
292, he remained on visiting term with hi relative (except of course the sackville bagginses) and he had many devoted admirer among the hobbit of poor and unimportant familie ,LOTR1,False
293, but he had no close friend until some of hi younger cousin began to grow up ,LOTR1,False
294, the eldest of these and bilbo favourite wa young frodo baggin ,LOTR1,False
295, when bilbo wa ninety nine he adopted frodo a hi heir and brought him to live at bag end; and the hope of the sackville bagginse were finally dashed ,LOTR1,False
296, bilbo and frodo happened to have the same birthday september numbernd ,LOTR1,False
297, you had better come and live here frodo my lad  said bilbo one day; and then we can celebrate our birthday partie comfortably together ,LOTR1,False
298, at that time frodo wa still in hi tween a the hobbit called the irresponsible twentie between childhood and coming of age at thirty three ,LOTR1,False
299, each year the bagginse had given very lively combined birthday partie at bag end; but now it wa understood that something quite exceptional wa being planned for that autumn ,LOTR1,False
300, bilbo wa going to be eleventy one number a rather curiou number and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the old took himself had only reached number); and frodo wa going to be thirty three number) an important number: the date of hi coming of age ,LOTR1,False
301, tongue began to wag in flobbiton and by water; and rumour of the coming event travelled all over the shire ,LOTR1,False
302, the history and character of mr bilbo baggin became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscence in welcome demand ,LOTR1,False
303, no one had a more attentive audience than old ham gamgee commonly known a the gaffer ,LOTR1,False
304, he held forth at the ivy bush a small inn on the bywater road; and he spoke with some authority for he had tended the garden at bag end for forty year and had helped old holman in the same job before that ,LOTR1,False
305, now that he wa himself growing old and stiff in the joint the job wa mainly carried on by hi youngest son sam gamgee ,LOTR1,False
306, both father and son were on very friendly term with bilbo and frodo ,LOTR1,False
307, they lived on the hill itself in number number bagshot row just below bag end ,LOTR1,False
308, a very nice well spoken gentlehobbit i mr bilbo a ive alway said  the gaffer declared ,LOTR1,False
309, with perfect truth: for bilbo wa very polite to him calling him master hamfast and consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetable in the matter of roots especially potatoe the gaffer wa recognized a the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood (including himself) ,LOTR1,False
310, but what about thi frodo that live with him ,LOTR1,False
311, asked old noake of by water ,LOTR1,False
312, baggin i hi name but he more than half a brandybuck they say ,LOTR1,False
313, it beat me why any baggin of hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in buckland where folk are so queer ,LOTR1,False
314, and no wonder theyre queer  put in daddy twofoot (the gaffer next door neighbour) if they live on the wrong side of the brandywine river and right agin the old forest ,LOTR1,False
315, that a dark bad place if half the tale be true ,LOTR1,False
316, not that the brandybuck of buck land live in the old forest; but theyre a queer breed seemingly ,LOTR1,False
317, they fool about with boat on that big river and that isnt natural ,LOTR1,False
318, small wonder that trouble came of it i say ,LOTR1,False
319, but be that a it may mr frodo i a nice a young hobbit a you could wish to meet ,LOTR1,False
320, very much like mr bilbo and in more than look ,LOTR1,False
321, after all hi father wa a baggin ,LOTR1,False
322, a decent respectable hobbit wa mr drogo baggins; there wa never much to tell of him till he wa drownded ,LOTR1,False
323, they had heard thi and other darker rumour before of course; but hobbit have a passion for family history and they were ready to hear it again ,LOTR1,False
324, well so they say  said the gaffer ,LOTR1,False
325, you see: mr drogo he married poor mis primula brandybuck ,LOTR1,False
326, she wa our mr bilbo first cousin on the mother side (her mother being the youngest of the old took daughters); and mr drogo wa hi second cousin ,LOTR1,False
327, so mr frodo i hi first and second cousin once removed either way a the saying i if you follow me ,LOTR1,False
328, and mr drogo wa staying at brandy flail with hi father in law old master gorbadoc a he often did after hi marriage (him being partial to hi vittle and old gorbadoc keeping a mighty generou table); and he went out boating on the brandywine river; and he and hi wife were drownded and poor mr frodo only a child and all ,LOTR1,False
329,  ive heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight  said old noakes; and it wa drogo weight a sunk the boat ,LOTR1,False
330, and / heard she pushed him in and he pulled her in after him  said sandy man the hobbiton miller ,LOTR1,False
331, you shouldnt listen to all you hear sandyman  said the gaffer who did not much like the miller ,LOTR1,False

834, he escorted her firmly off the premise after he had relieved her of several small (but rather valuable) article that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella ,LOTR1,False
835, her face looked a if she wa in the throe of thinking out a really crushing parting remark; but all she found to say turning round on the step was: youll live to regret it young fellow ,LOTR1,False
836, why didnt you go too ,LOTR1,False
837, you dont belong here; youre no baggin you youre a brandybuck ,LOTR1,False

848, he had hardly sat down when there came a soft knock at the front door ,LOTR1,False
849, lobelia again most likely  he thought ,LOTR1,False
850, she must have thought of something really nasty and have come back again to say it ,LOTR1,False
851, he went on with hi tea ,LOTR1,False
852, the knock wa repeated much louder but he took no notice ,LOTR1,False
853, suddenly the wizard head appeared at the window ,LOTR1,False
854, if you dont let me in frodo i shall blow your door right down your hole and out through the hill  he said ,LOTR1,False
855, cried frodo running out of the room to the door ,LOTR1,False
856, i thought it wa lobelia ,LOTR1,False
857, but i saw her some time ago driving a pony trap toward bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk ,LOTR1,False
858, she had already nearly curdled me ,LOTR1,False
859, honestly i nearly tried on bilbo ring ,LOTR1,False

861, in fact it i partly about that that i have come to say a last word ,LOTR1,False

870, that interesting  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
871, well what did you think of it all ,LOTR1,False
872, if you mean inventing all that about a present well i thought the true story much more likely and i couldnt see the point of altering it at all ,LOTR1,False
873, it wa very unlike bilbo to do so anyway; and i thought it rather odd ,LOTR1,False
874, but odd thing may happen to people that have such treasure if they use them ,LOTR1,False
875, let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it ,LOTR1,False
876, it may have other power than just making you vanish when you wish to ,LOTR1,False
877, i dont understand  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
878, neither do i  answered the wizard ,LOTR1,False
879, i have merely begun to wonder about the ring especially since last night ,LOTR1,False
880, but if you take my advice you will use it very seldom or not at all ,LOTR1,False
881, at least i beg you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion ,LOTR1,False
882, i say again: keep it safe and keep it secret ,LOTR1,False
883, what are you afraid of ,LOTR1,False

896, some people are actually accusing me of spiriting bilbo away or worse ,LOTR1,False
897, if you want to know there i supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of hi wealth ,LOTR1,False
898, you mean otho and lobelia ,LOTR1,False
899, i would give them bag end and everything else if i could get bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with him ,LOTR1,False
900, but i begin to wish somehow that i had gone too ,LOTR1,False
901, i wonder if i shall ever see him again ,LOTR1,False
902, so do i  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
903, and i wonder many other thing ,LOTR1,False
904, lookout for me especially at unlikely time  ,LOTR1,False
905, frodo saw him to the door ,LOTR1,False
906, he gave a final wave of hi hand and walked off at a surprising pace; but frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent almost a if he wa carrying a great weight ,LOTR1,False
907, the evening wa closing in and hi cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight ,LOTR1,False
908, frodo did not see him again for a long time ,LOTR1,False
909, the shadow of the past the talk did not die down in nine or even ninety nine day ,LOTR1,False
910, the second disappearance of mr bilbo baggin wa discussed in hobbiton and indeed all over the shire for a year and a day and wa remembered much longer than that ,LOTR1,False
911, it became a fireside story for young hobbits; and eventually mad baggin who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bag of jewel and gold became a favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the true event were forgotten ,LOTR1,False
912, but in the meantime the general opinion in the neighbourhood wa that bilbo who had alway been rather cracked had at last gone quite mad and had run off into the blue ,LOTR1,False
913, there he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic but hardly an untimely end ,LOTR1,False
914, the blame wa mostly laid on gandalf ,LOTR1,False
915, if only that dratted wizard will leave young frodo alone perhap hell settle down and grow some hobbit sense  they said ,LOTR1,False
916, and to all appearance the wizard did leave frodo alone and he did settle down but the growth of hobbit sense wa not very noticeable ,LOTR1,False
917, indeed he at once began to carry on bilbo reputation for oddity ,LOTR1,False
918, he refused to go into mourning; and the next year he gave a party in honour of bilbo hundred and twelfth birthday which he called hundred weight feast ,LOTR1,False
919, but that wa short of the mark for twenty guest were invited and there were several meal at which it snowed food and rained drink a hobbit say ,LOTR1,False
920, some people were rather shocked; but frodo kept up the custom of giving bilbo birthday party year after year until they got used to it ,LOTR1,False
921, he said that he did not think bilbo wa dead ,LOTR1,False
922, when they asked: where i he then ,LOTR1,False
923, he lived alone a bilbo had done; but he had a good many friend especially among the younger hobbit (mostly descendant of the old took) who had a children been fond of bilbo and often in and out of bag end ,LOTR1,False
924, folco boffin and fredegar bolger were two of these; but hi closest friend were peregrin took (usually called pippin) and merry brandybuck (hi real name wa meriadoc but that wa seldom remembered) ,LOTR1,False
925, frodo went tramping all over the shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself and to the amazement of sensible folk he wa sometime seen far from home walking in the hill and wood under the starlight ,LOTR1,False
926, merry and pippin suspected that he visited the elve at time a bilbo had done ,LOTR1,False
927, a time went on people began to notice that frodo also showed sign of good preservation: outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of hi tween ,LOTR1,False
928, some folk have all the luck  they said; but it wa not until frodo approached the usually more sober age of fifty that they began to think it queer ,LOTR1,False
929, frodo himself after the first shock found that being hi own master and the mr baggin of bag end wa rather pleasant ,LOTR1,False
930, for some year he wa quite happy and did not worry much about the future ,LOTR1,False
931, but half unknown to himself the regret that he had not gone with bilbo wa steadily growing ,LOTR1,False
932, he found himself wondering at time especially in the autumn about the wild land and strange vision of mountain that he had never seen came into hi dream he began to say to himself: perhap i shall cros the river myself one day ,LOTR1,False
933, to which the other half of hi mind alway replied: not yet ,LOTR1,False
934, so it went on until hi fortie were running out and hi fiftieth birthday wa drawing near: fifty wa a number that he felt wa somehow significant (or ominous); it wa at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen bilbo ,LOTR1,False
935, frodo began to feel restl and the old path seemed too well trodden ,LOTR1,False
936, he looked at map and wondered what lay beyond their edges: map made in the shire showed mostly white space beyond it border ,LOTR1,False
937, he took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and merry and hi other friend watched him anxiously ,LOTR1,False
938, often he wa seen walking and talking with the strange wayfarer that began at thi time to appear in the shire ,LOTR1,False
939, there were rumour of strange thing happening in the world outside; and a gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several year frodo gathered all the new he could ,LOTR1,False
940, elve who seldom walked in the shire could now be seen passing westward through the wood in the evening passing and not returning; but they were leaving middle earth and were no longer concerned with it trouble ,LOTR1,False
941, there were however dwarve on the road in unusual number ,LOTR1,False
942, the ancient east west road ran through the shire to it end at the grey haven and dwarve had alway used it on their way to their mine in the blue mountain ,LOTR1,False
943, they were the hobbits chief source of new from distant part if they wanted any: a a rule dwarve said little and hobbit asked no more ,LOTR1,False
944, but now frodo often met strange dwarve of far countrie seeking refuge in the west ,LOTR1,False
945, they were troubled and some spoke in whisper of the enemy and of the land of mordor ,LOTR1,False
946, that name the hobbit only knew in legend of the dark past like a shadow in the background of their memories; but it wa ominou and disquieting ,LOTR1,False
947, it seemed that the evil power in mirkwood had been driven out by the white council only to reappear in greater strength in the old stronghold of mordor ,LOTR1,False
948, the dark tower had been rebuilt it wa said ,LOTR1,False
949, from there the power wa spreading far and wide and away far east and south there were war and growing fear ,LOTR1,False
950, ore were multiplying again in the mountain ,LOTR1,False
951, troll were abroad no longer dull witted but cunning and armed with dreadful weapon ,LOTR1,False
952, and there were murmured hint of creature more terrible than all these but they had no name ,LOTR1,False
953, little of all thi of course reached the ear of ordinary hobbit ,LOTR1,False
954, but even the deafest and most stay at home began to hear queer tales; and those whose busin took them to the border saw strange thing ,LOTR1,False
955, the conversation in the green dragon at bywater one evening in the spring of frodo fiftieth year showed that even in the comfortable heart of the shire rumour had been heard though most hobbit still laughed at them ,LOTR1,False
956, sam gamgee wa sitting in one corner near the fire and opposite him wa ted sandyman the miller son; and there were variou other rustic hobbit listening to their talk ,LOTR1,False
957, queer thing you do hear these day to be sure  said sam ,LOTR1,False
958, ah  said ted you do if you listen ,LOTR1,False
959, but i can hear fireside tale and children storie at home if i want to ,LOTR1,False
960, no doubt you can  retorted sam and i daresay there more truth in some of them than you reckon ,LOTR1,False
961, who invented the storie anyway ,LOTR1,False
962, no thank ee  said ted i wont ,LOTR1,False
963, i heard tell of them when i wa a youngster but there no call to believe in them now ,LOTR1,False
964, there only one dragon in by water and that green  he said getting a general laugh ,LOTR1,False
965, all right  said sam laughing with the rest ,LOTR1,False
966, but what about these tree men these giant a you might call them ,LOTR1,False
967, they do say that one bigger than a tree wa seen up away beyond the north moor not long back ,LOTR1,False
968, who theyt my cousin hal for one ,LOTR1,False
969, he work for mr boffin at overhill and goe up to the northfarthing for the hunting ,LOTR1,False
970, your hal alway saying he seen things; and maybe he see thing that aint there ,LOTR1,False
971, but thi one wa a big a an elm tree and walking walking seven yard to a stride if it wa an inch ,LOTR1,False
972, then i bet it wasnt an inch ,LOTR1,False
973, what he saw wa an elm tree a like a not ,LOTR1,False
974, but thi one wa walking i tell you; and there aint no elm tree on the north moor ,LOTR1,False
975, then hal cant have seen one  said ted ,LOTR1,False
976, there wa some laughing and clapping: the audience seemed to think that ted had scored a point ,LOTR1,False
977, all the same  said sam you cant deny that other beside our halfast have seen queer folk crossing the shire crossing it mind you: there are more that are turned back at the border ,LOTR1,False
978, the bounder have never been so busy before ,LOTR1,False
979, and ive heard tell that elve are moving west ,LOTR1,False
980, they do say they are going to the harbour out away beyond the white tower ,LOTR1,False
981, sam waved hi arm vaguely: neither he nor any of them knew how far it wa to the sea past the old tower beyond the western border of the shire ,LOTR1,False
982, but it wa an old tradition that away over there stood the grey haven from which at time elven ship set sail never to return ,LOTR1,False
983, they are sailing sailing sailing over the sea they are going into the west and leaving u  said sam half chanting the word shaking hi head sadly and solemnly ,LOTR1,False
984, well that isnt anything new if you believe the old tale ,LOTR1,False
985, and i dont see what it matter to me or you ,LOTR1,False
986, but i warrant you havent seen them doing it; nor any one else in the shire ,LOTR1,False
987, well i dont know  said sam thoughtfully ,LOTR1,False
988, he believed he had once seen an elf in the wood and still hoped to see more one day ,LOTR1,False
989, of all the legend that he had heard in hi early year such fragment of tale and half remembered storie about the elve a the hobbit knew had alway moved him most deeply ,LOTR1,False
990, there are some even in these part a know the fair folk and get new of them  he said ,LOTR1,False
991, there mr baggin now that i work for ,LOTR1,False
992, he told me that they were sailing and he know a bit about elve ,LOTR1,False
993, and old mr bilbo knew more: many the talk i had with him when i wa a little lad ,LOTR1,False
994, oh theyre both cracked  said ted ,LOTR1,False
995, leastway old bilbo wa cracked and frodo cracking ,LOTR1,False
996, if that where you get your new from youll never want for moonshine ,LOTR1,False
997, well friend im off home ,LOTR1,False
998, he drained hi mug and went out noisily ,LOTR1,False
999, sam sat silent and said no more ,LOTR1,False
1000, he had a good deal to think about ,LOTR1,False
1001, for one thing there wa a lot to do up in the bag end garden and he would have a busy day tomorrow if the weather cleared ,LOTR1,False
1002, the gras wa growing fast ,LOTR1,False
1003, but sam had more on hi mind than gardening ,LOTR1,False
1004, after a while he sighed and got up and went out ,LOTR1,False
1005, it wa early april and the sky wa now clearing after heavy rain ,LOTR1,False
1006, the sun wa down and a cool pale evening wa quietly fading into night ,LOTR1,False
1007, he walked home under the early star through hobbiton and up the hill whistling softly and thoughtfully ,LOTR1,False
1008, it wa just at thi time that gandalf reappeared after hi long absence ,LOTR1,False
1009, for three year after the party he had been away ,LOTR1,False
1010, then he paid frodo a brief visit and after taking a good look at him he went off again ,LOTR1,False
1011, during the next year or two he had turned up fairly often coming unexpectedly after dusk and going off without warning before sunrise ,LOTR1,False
1012, he would not discus hi own busin and journey and seemed chiefly interested in small new about frodo health and doing ,LOTR1,False
1013, then suddenly hi visit had ceased ,LOTR1,False
1014, it wa over nine year since frodo had seen or heard of him and he had begun to think that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbit ,LOTR1,False
1015, but that evening a sam wa walking home and twilight wa fading there came the once familiar tap on the study window ,LOTR1,False
1016, frodo welcomed hi old friend with surprise and great delight ,LOTR1,False
1017, they looked hard at one another ,LOTR1,False
1018, you look the same a ever frodo ,LOTR1,False
1019, so do you  frodo replied; but secretly he thought that gandalf looked older and more careworn ,LOTR1,False
1020, he pressed him for new of himself and of the wide world and soon they were deep in talk and they stayed up far into the night ,LOTR1,False
1021, next morning after a late breakfast the wizard wa sitting with frodo by the open window of the study ,LOTR1,False
1022, a bright fire wa on the hearth but the sun wa warm and the wind wa in the south ,LOTR1,False
1023, everything looked fresh and the new green of spring wa shimmering in the field and on the tip of the trees finger ,LOTR1,False
1024, gandalf wa thinking of a spring nearly eighty year before when bilbo had run out of bag end without a handkerchief ,LOTR1,False
1025, hi hair wa perhap whiter than it had been then and hi beard and eyebrow were perhap longer and hi face more lined with care and wisdom; but hi eye were a bright a ever and he smoked and blew smoke ring with the same vigour and delight ,LOTR1,False
1026, he wa smoking now in silence for frodo wa sitting still deep in thought ,LOTR1,False
1027, even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tiding that gandalf had brought ,LOTR1,False
1028, at last he broke the silence ,LOTR1,False
1029, last night you began to tell me strange thing about my ring gandalf  he said ,LOTR1,False
1030, and then you stopped because you said that such matter were best left until daylight ,LOTR1,False
1031, dont you think you had better finish now ,LOTR1,False
1032, you say the ring i dangerou far more dangerou than i gu ,LOTR1,False
1033, in many way  answered the wizard ,LOTR1,False
1034, it i far more powerful than i ever dared to think at first so powerful that in the end it would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it ,LOTR1,False
1035, in eregion long ago many elven ring were made magic ring a you call them and they were of course of variou kinds: some more potent and some l ,LOTR1,False
1036, the lesser ring were only essay in the craft before it wa full grown and to the elven smith they were but trifle yet still to my mind dangerou for mortal ,LOTR1,False
1037, but the great ring the ring of power they were perilou ,LOTR1,False
1038, a mortal frodo who keep one of the great ring doe not die but he doe not grow or obtain more life he merely continue until at last every minute i a wearin ,LOTR1,False
1039, and if he often use the ring to make himself invisible he fades: he become in the end invisible permanently and walk in the twilight under the eye of the dark power that rule the ring ,LOTR1,False
1040, ye sooner or later later if he i strong or well meaning to begin with but neither strength nor good purpose will last sooner or later the dark power will devour him ,LOTR1,False
1041, there wa another long silence ,LOTR1,False
1042, the sound of sam gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden ,LOTR1,False
1043, how long have you known this ,LOTR1,False
1044, and how much did bilbo know ,LOTR1,False
1045, bilbo knew no more than he told you i am sure  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1046, he would certainly never have passed on to you anything that he thought would be a danger even though i promised to look after you ,LOTR1,False
1047, he thought the ring wa very beautiful and very useful at need; and if anything wa wrong or queer it wa himself ,LOTR1,False
1048, he said that it wa growing on hi mind and he wa alway worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself wa to blame ,LOTR1,False
1049, though he had found out that the thing needed looking after; it did not seem alway of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded in an odd way and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight ,LOTR1,False
1050, ye he warned me of that in hi last letter  said frodo so i have alway kept it on it chain ,LOTR1,False
1051, very wise  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1052, but a for hi long life bilbo never connected it with the ring at all ,LOTR1,False
1053, he took all the credit for that to himself and he wa very proud of it ,LOTR1,False
1054, though he wa getting restl and uneasy ,LOTR1,False
1055, thin and stretched he said ,LOTR1,False
1056, a sign that the ring wa getting control ,LOTR1,False
1057, how long have you known all this ,LOTR1,False
1058, i have known much that only the wise know frodo ,LOTR1,False
1059, but if you mean known about thi ring well i still do not know one might say ,LOTR1,False
1060, there i a last test to make ,LOTR1,False
1061, but i no longer doubt my gu ,LOTR1,False
1062, when did i first begin to guess ,LOTR1,False
1063, he mused searching back in memory ,LOTR1,False
1064, let me see it wa in the year that the white council drove the dark power from mirkwood just before the battle of five armie that bilbo found hi ring ,LOTR1,False
1065, a shadow fell on my heart then though i did not know yet what i feared ,LOTR1,False
1066, i wondered often how gollum came by a great ring a plainly it wa that at least wa clear from the first ,LOTR1,False
1067, then i heard bilbo strange story of how he had won it and i could not believe it ,LOTR1,False
1068, when i at last got the truth out of him i saw at once that he had been trying to put hi claim to the ring beyond doubt ,LOTR1,False
1069, much like gollum with hi birthday present ,LOTR1,False
1070, the lie were too much alike for my comfort ,LOTR1,False
1071, clearly the ring had an unwholesome power that set to work on it keeper at once ,LOTR1,False
1072, that wa the first real warning i had that all wa not well ,LOTR1,False
1073, i told bilbo often that such ring were better left unused; but he resented it and soon got angry ,LOTR1,False
1074, there wa little else that i could do ,LOTR1,False
1075, i could not take it from him without doing greater harm; and i had no right to do so anyway ,LOTR1,False
1076, i could only watch and wait ,LOTR1,False
1077, i might perhap have consulted saruman the white but something alway held me back ,LOTR1,False
1078, i have never heard of him before ,LOTR1,False
1079, maybe not  answered gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1080, hobbit are or were no concern of hi ,LOTR1,False
1081, yet he i great among the wise ,LOTR1,False
1082, he i the chief of my order and the head of the council ,LOTR1,False
1083, hi knowledge i deep but hi pride ha grown with it and he take ill any meddling ,LOTR1,False
1084, the lore of the elven ring great and small i hi province ,LOTR1,False
1085, he ha long studied it seeking the lost secret of their making; but when the ring were debated in the council all that he would reveal to u of hi ring lore told against my fear ,LOTR1,False
1086, so my doubt slept but uneasily ,LOTR1,False
1087, still i watched and i waited ,LOTR1,False
1088, and all seemed well with bilbo ,LOTR1,False
1089, ye they passed and they seemed not to touch him ,LOTR1,False
1090, he showed no sign of age ,LOTR1,False
1091, the shadow fell on me again ,LOTR1,False
1092, but i said to myself: after all he come of a long lived family on hi mother side ,LOTR1,False
1093, until that night when he left thi house ,LOTR1,False
1094, he said and did thing then that filled me with a fear that no word of saruman could allay ,LOTR1,False
1095, i knew at last that something dark and deadly wa at work ,LOTR1,False
1096, and i have spent most of the year since then in finding out the truth of it ,LOTR1,False
1097, there wasnt any permanent harm done wa there ,LOTR1,False
1098, he would get all right in time wouldnt he ,LOTR1,False
1099, be able to rest in peace i mean ,LOTR1,False
1100, he felt better at once  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1101, but there i only one power in thi world that know all about the ring and their effects; and a far a i know there i no power in the world that know all about hobbit ,LOTR1,False
1102, among the wise i am the only one that goe in for hobbit lore: an obscure branch of knowledge but full of surprise ,LOTR1,False
1103, soft a butter they can be and yet sometime a tough a old tree root ,LOTR1,False
1104, i think it likely that some would resist the ring far longer than most of the wise would believe ,LOTR1,False
1105, i dont think you need worry about bilbo ,LOTR1,False
1106, of course he possessed the ring for many year and used it so it might take a long while for the influence to wear off before it wa safe for him to see it again for instance ,LOTR1,False
1107, otherwise he might live on for year quite happily: just stop a he wa when he parted with it ,LOTR1,False
1108, for he gave it up in the end of hi own accord: an important point ,LOTR1,False
1109, no i wa not troubled about dear bilbo any more once he had let the thing go ,LOTR1,False
1110, it i for you that i feel responsible ,LOTR1,False
1111, ever since bilbo left i have been deeply concerned about you and about all these charming absurd helpl hobbit ,LOTR1,False
1112, it would be a grievou blow to the world if the dark power overcame the shire; if all your kind jolly stupid bolger hornblower boffin bracegirdle and the rest not to mention the ridiculou bagginse became enslaved ,LOTR1,False
1113, but why should we be ,LOTR1,False
1114, and why should he want such slaves ,LOTR1,False
1115, to tell you the truth  replied gandalf i believe that hitherto hitherto mark you he ha entirely overlooked the existence of hobbit ,LOTR1,False
1116, but your safety ha passed ,LOTR1,False
1117, he doe not need you he ha many more useful servant but he wont forget you again ,LOTR1,False
1118, and hobbit a miserable slave would please him far more than hobbit happy and free ,LOTR1,False
1119, there i such a thing a malice and revenge ,LOTR1,False
1120, i still dont understand what all thi ha to do with bilbo and myself and our ring ,LOTR1,False
1121, it ha everything to do with it  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1122, you do not know the real peril yet; but you shall ,LOTR1,False
1123, i wa not sure of it myself when i wa last here; but the time ha come to speak ,LOTR1,False
1124, give me the ring for a moment ,LOTR1,False
1125, frodo took it from hi breeches pocket where it wa clasped to a chain that hung from hi belt ,LOTR1,False
1126, he unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizard ,LOTR1,False
1127, it felt suddenly very heavy a if either it or frodo himself wa in some way reluctant for gandalf to touch it ,LOTR1,False
1128, it looked to be made of pure and solid gold ,LOTR1,False
1129, can you see any marking on it ,LOTR1,False
1130, it i quite plain and it never show a scratch or sign of wear ,LOTR1,False
1131, to frodo astonishment and distr the wizard threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire ,LOTR1,False
1132, frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs; but gandalf held him back ,LOTR1,False
1133, he said in a commanding voice giving frodo a quick look from under hi bristling brow ,LOTR1,False
1134, no apparent change came over the ring ,LOTR1,False
1135, after a while gandalf got up closed the shutter outside the window and drew the curtain ,LOTR1,False
1136, the room became dark and silent though the clack of sam shear now nearer to the window could still be heard faintly from the garden ,LOTR1,False
1137, for a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire; then he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth with the tong and at once picked it up ,LOTR1,False
1138, it i quite cool  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1139, frodo received it on hi shrinking palm: it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever ,LOTR1,False
1140, a frodo did so he now saw fine line finer than the finest pen stroke running along the ring outside and inside: line of fire that seemed to form the letter of a flowing script ,LOTR1,False
1141, they shone piercingly bright and yet remote a if out of a great depth ,LOTR1,False
1142, i cannot read the fiery letter  said frodo in a quavering voice ,LOTR1,False
1143, no  said gandalf but i can ,LOTR1,False
1144, the letter are elvish of an ancient mode but the language i that of mordor which i will not utter here ,LOTR1,False
1145, but thi in the common tongue i what i said close enough: one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkn bind them ,LOTR1,False
1146, it i only two line of a verse long known in elven lore: three ring for the elven king under the sky seven for the dwarf lord in their hall of stone nine for mortal men doomed to die one for the dark lord on hi dark throne in the land of mordor where the shadow lie ,LOTR1,False
1147, one ring to rule them all ,LOTR1,False
1148, one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkn bind them in the land of mordor where the shadow lie ,LOTR1,False
1149,  he paused and then said slowly in a deep voice: thi i the master ring the one ring to rule them all ,LOTR1,False
1150, thi i the one ring that he lost many age ago to the great weakening of hi power ,LOTR1,False
1151, he greatly desire it but he must not get it ,LOTR1,False
1152, frodo sat silent and motionl ,LOTR1,False
1153, fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand like a dark cloud rising in the east and looming up to engulf him ,LOTR1,False
1154, how how on earth did it come to me ,LOTR1,False
1155, that i a very long story ,LOTR1,False
1156, the beginning lie back in the black year which only the lore master now remember ,LOTR1,False
1157, if i were to tell you all that tale we should still be sitting here when spring had passed into winter ,LOTR1,False
1158, but last night i told you of sauron the great the dark lord ,LOTR1,False
1159, the rumour that you have heard are true: he ha indeed arisen again and left hi hold in mirkwood and returned to hi ancient fastn in the dark tower of mordor ,LOTR1,False
1160, that name even you hobbit have heard of like a shadow on the border of old storie ,LOTR1,False
1161, alway after a defeat and a respite the shadow take another shape and grow again ,LOTR1,False
1162, i wish it need not have happened in my time  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
1163, so do i  said gandalf and so do all who live to see such time ,LOTR1,False
1164, but that i not for them to decide ,LOTR1,False
1165, all we have to decide i what to do with the time that i given u ,LOTR1,False
1166, and already frodo our time i beginning to look black ,LOTR1,False
1167, the enemy i fast becoming very strong ,LOTR1,False
1168, hi plan are far from ripe i think but they are ripening ,LOTR1,False
1169, we shall be hard put to it ,LOTR1,False
1170, we should be very hard put to it even if it were not for thi dreadful chance ,LOTR1,False
1171, the enemy still lack one thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat down all resistance break the last defence and cover all the land in a second darkn ,LOTR1,False
1172, he lack the one ring ,LOTR1,False
1173, the three fairest of all the elf lord hid from him and hi hand never touched them or sullied them ,LOTR1,False
1174, seven the dwarf king possessed but three he ha recovered and the other the dragon have consumed ,LOTR1,False
1175, nine he gave to mortal men proud and great and so ensnared them ,LOTR1,False
1176, long ago they fell under the dominion of the one and they became ringwraith shadow under hi great shadow hi most terrible servant ,LOTR1,False
1177, it i many a year since the nine walked abroad ,LOTR1,False
1178, a the shadow grow once more they too may walk again ,LOTR1,False
1179, we will not speak of such thing even in the morning of the shire ,LOTR1,False
1180, so it i now: the nine he ha gathered to himself; the seven also or else they are destroyed ,LOTR1,False
1181, the three are hidden still ,LOTR1,False
1182, but that no longer trouble him ,LOTR1,False
1183, he only need the one; for he made that ring himself it i hi and he let a great part of hi own former power pas into it so that he could rule all the other ,LOTR1,False
1184, if he recover it then he will command them all again wherever they be even the three and all that ha been wrought with them will be laid bare and he will be stronger than ever ,LOTR1,False
1185, and thi i the dreadful chance frodo ,LOTR1,False
1186, he believed that the one had perished; that the elve had destroyed it a should have been done ,LOTR1,False
1187, but he know now that it ha not perished that it ha been found ,LOTR1,False
1188, so he i seeking it seeking it and all hi thought i bent on it ,LOTR1,False
1189, it i hi great hope and our great fear ,LOTR1,False
1190, why why wasnt it destroyed ,LOTR1,False
1191, and how did the enemy ever come to lose it if he wa so strong and it wa so preciou to him ,LOTR1,False
1192, he clutched the ring in hi hand a if he saw already dark finger stretching out to seize it ,LOTR1,False
1193, it wa taken from him  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1194, the strength of the elve to resist him wa greater long ago; and not all men were estranged from them ,LOTR1,False
1195, the men of westernesse came to their aid ,LOTR1,False
1196, that i a chapter of ancient history which it might be good to recall; for there wa sorrow then too and gathering dark but great valour and great deed that were not wholly vain ,LOTR1,False
1197, one day perhap i will tell you all the tale or you shall hear it told in full by one who know it best ,LOTR1,False
1198, but for the moment since most of all you need to know how thi thing came to you and that will be tale enough thi i all that i will say ,LOTR1,False
1199, it wa gil galad elven king and elendil of westernesse who overthrew sauron though they themselve perished in the deed; and isildur elendil son cut the ring from sauron hand and took it for hi own ,LOTR1,False
1200, then sauron wa vanquished and hi spirit fled and wa hidden for long year until hi shadow took shape again in mirkwood ,LOTR1,False
1201, but the ring wa lost ,LOTR1,False
1202, it fell into the great river anduin and vanished ,LOTR1,False
1203, for isildur wa marching north along the east bank of the river and near the gladden field he wa waylaid by the ore of the mountain and almost all hi folk were slain ,LOTR1,False
1204, he leaped into the water but the ring slipped from hi finger a he swam and then the ore saw him and killed him with arrow ,LOTR1,False
1205, and there in the dark pool amid the gladden field  he said the ring passed out of knowledge and legend; and even so much of it history i known now only to a few and the council of the wise could discover no more ,LOTR1,False
1206, but at last i can carry on the story i think ,LOTR1,False
1207, fong after but still very long ago there lived by the bank of the great river on the edge of wilderland a clever handed and quiet footed little people ,LOTR1,False
1208, i gu they were of hobbit kind; akin to the father of the father of the stoor for they loved the river and often swam in it or made little boat of reed ,LOTR1,False
1209, there wa among them a family of high repute for it wa large and wealthier than most and it wa ruled by a grandmother of the folk stern and wise in old lore such a they had ,LOTR1,False
1210, the most inquisitive and curious minded of that family wa called smjagol ,LOTR1,False
1211, he wa interested in root and beginnings; he dived into deep pools; he burrowed under tree and growing plants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and he ceased to look up at the hill top or the leave on tree or the flower opening in the air: hi head and hi eye were downward ,LOTR1,False
1212, he had a friend called djagol of similar sort sharper eyed but not so quick and strong ,LOTR1,False
1213, on a time they took a boat and went down to the gladden field where there were great bed of iri and flowering reed ,LOTR1,False
1214, there smjagol got out and went nosing about the bank but deal sat in the boat and fished ,LOTR1,False
1215, suddenly a great fish took hi hook and before he knew where he wa he wa dragged out and down into the water to the bottom ,LOTR1,False
1216, then he let go of hi line for he thought he saw something shining in the river bed; and holding hi breath he grabbed at it ,LOTR1,False
1217, then up he came spluttering with weed in hi hair and a handful of mud; and he swam to the bank ,LOTR1,False
1218, when he washed the mud away there in hi hand lay a beautiful golden ring; and it shone and glittered in the sun so that hi heart wa glad ,LOTR1,False
1219, but smjagol had been watching him from behind a tree and a deal gloated over the ring smjagol came softly up behind ,LOTR1,False
1220, give u that deal my love said smjagol over hi friend shoulder ,LOTR1,False
1221,  because it my birthday my love and i want it said smjagol ,LOTR1,False
1222, i dont care said deal ,LOTR1,False
1223, i have given you a present already more than i could afford ,LOTR1,False
1224, i found thi and im going to keep it ,LOTR1,False
1225,  oh are you indeed my love said smjagol; and he caught deal by the throat and strangled him because the gold looked so bright and beautiful ,LOTR1,False
1226, then he put the ring on hi finger ,LOTR1,False
1227, no one ever found out what had become of deal; he wa murdered far from home and hi body wa cunningly hidden ,LOTR1,False
1228, but smjagol returned alone; and he found that none of hi family could see him when he wa wearing the ring ,LOTR1,False
1229, he wa very pleased with hi discovery and he concealed it; and he used it to find out secret and he put hi knowledge to crooked and maliciou use ,LOTR1,False
1230, he became sharp eyed and keen eared for all that wa hurtful ,LOTR1,False
1231, the ring had given him power according to hi stature ,LOTR1,False
1232, it i not to be wondered at that he became very unpopular and wa shunned (when visible) by all hi relation ,LOTR1,False
1233, they kicked him and he bit their feet ,LOTR1,False
1234, he took to thieving and going about muttering to himself and gurgling in hi throat ,LOTR1,False
1235, so they called him gollum and cursed him and told him to go far away; and hi grandmother desiring peace expelled him from the family and turned him out of her hole ,LOTR1,False
1236, he wandered in lonelin weeping a little for the hardn of the world and he journeyed up the river till he came to a stream that flowed down from the mountain and he went that way ,LOTR1,False
1237, he caught fish in deep pool with invisible finger and ate them raw ,LOTR1,False
1238, one day it wa very hot and a he wa bending over a pool he felt a burning on the back of hi head) and a dazzling light from the water pained hi wet eye ,LOTR1,False
1239, he wondered at it for he had almost forgotten about the sun ,LOTR1,False
1240, then for the last time he looked up and shook hi fist at her ,LOTR1,False
1241, but a he lowered hi eye he saw far above the top of the misty mountain out of which the stream came ,LOTR1,False
1242, and he thought suddenly: it would be cool and shady under those mountain ,LOTR1,False
1243, the sun could not watch me there ,LOTR1,False
1244, the root of those mountain must be root indeed; there must be great secret buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning ,LOTR1,False
1245, so he journeyed by night up into the highland and he found a little cave out of which the dark stream ran; and he wormed hi way like a maggot into the heart of the hill and vanished out of all knowledge ,LOTR1,False
1246, the ring went into the shadow with him and even the maker when hi power had begun to grow again could learn nothing of it ,LOTR1,False
1247, do you mean that thi i the very gollum creature that bilbo met ,LOTR1,False
1248, i think it i a sad story  said the wizard and it might have happened to other even to some hobbit that i have known ,LOTR1,False
1249, i cant believe that gollum wa connected with hobbit however distantly  said frodo with some heat ,LOTR1,False
1250, it i true all the same  replied gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1251, about their origin at any rate i know more than hobbit do themselve ,LOTR1,False
1252, and even bilbo story suggest the kinship ,LOTR1,False
1253, there wa a great deal in the background of their mind and memorie that wa very similar ,LOTR1,False
1254, they understood one another remarkably well very much better than a hobbit would understand say a dwarf or an ore or even an elf ,LOTR1,False
1255, think of the riddle they both knew for one thing ,LOTR1,False
1256, though other folk beside hobbit ask riddle and of much the same sort ,LOTR1,False
1257, gollum meant to cheat all the time ,LOTR1,False
1258, he wa just trying to put poor bilbo off hi guard ,LOTR1,False
1259, and i daresay it amused hi wickedn to start a game which might end in providing him with an easy victim but if he lost would not hurt him ,LOTR1,False
1260, only too true i fear  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1261, but there wa something else in it i think which you dont see yet ,LOTR1,False
1262, even gollum wa not wholly ruined ,LOTR1,False
1263, he had proved tougher than even one of the wise would have guessed a a hobbit might ,LOTR1,False
1264, there wa a little corner of hi mind that wa still hi own and light came through it a through a chink in the dark: light out of the past ,LOTR1,False
1265, it wa actually pleasant i think to hear a kindly voice again bringing up memorie of wind and tree and sun on the gras and such forgotten thing ,LOTR1,False
1266, but that of course would only make the evil part of him angrier in the end unl it could be conquered ,LOTR1,False
1267, unl it could be cured ,LOTR1,False
1268, there i little hope of that for him ,LOTR1,False
1269, no not though he possessed the ring so long almost a far back a he can remember ,LOTR1,False
1270, for it wa long since he had worn it much: in the black darkn it wa seldom needed ,LOTR1,False
1271, certainly he had never faded ,LOTR1,False
1272, he i thin and tough still ,LOTR1,False
1273, but the thing wa eating up hi mind of course and the torment had become almost unbearable ,LOTR1,False
1274, all the great secrets under the mountain had turned out to be just empty night: there wa nothing more to find out nothing worth doing only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering ,LOTR1,False
1275, he hated the dark and he hated light more: he hated everything and the ring most of all ,LOTR1,False
1276, surely the ring wa hi preciou and the only thing he cared for ,LOTR1,False
1277, but if he hated it why didnt he get rid of it or go away and leave it ,LOTR1,False
1278, you ought to begin to understand frodo after all you have heard  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1279, he hated it and loved it a he hated and loved himself ,LOTR1,False
1280, he could not get rid of it ,LOTR1,False
1281, he had no will left in the matter ,LOTR1,False
1282, a ring of power look after itself frodo ,LOTR1,False
1283, it may slip off treacherously but it keeper never abandon it ,LOTR1,False
1284, at most he play with the idea of handing it on to someone else care and that only at an early stage when it first begin to grip ,LOTR1,False
1285, but a far a i know bilbo alone in history ha ever gone beyond playing and really done it ,LOTR1,False
1286, he needed all my help too ,LOTR1,False
1287, and even so he would never have just forsaken it or cast it aside ,LOTR1,False
1288, it wa not gollum frodo but the ring itself that decided thing ,LOTR1,False
1289,  what just in time to meet bilbo ,LOTR1,False
1290, wouldnt an ore have suited it better ,LOTR1,False
1291, it i no laughing matter  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1292, it wa the strangest event in the whole history of the ring so far: bilbo arrival just at that time and putting hi hand on it blindly in the dark ,LOTR1,False
1293, there wa more than one power at work frodo ,LOTR1,False
1294, the ring wa trying to get back to it master ,LOTR1,False
1295, it had slipped from isildur hand and betrayed him; then when a chance came it caught poor deal and he wa murdered; and after that gollum and it had devoured him ,LOTR1,False
1296, it could make no further use of him: he wa too small and mean; and a long a it stayed with him he would never leave hi deep pool again ,LOTR1,False
1297, so now when it master wa awake once more and sending out hi dark thought from mirkwood it abandoned gollum ,LOTR1,False
1298, only to be picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: bilbo from the shire ,LOTR1,False
1299, behind that there wa something else at work beyond any design of the ring maker ,LOTR1,False
1300, i can put it no plainer than by saying that bilbo wa meant to find the ring and not by it maker ,LOTR1,False
1301, in which case you also were meant to have it ,LOTR1,False
1302, and that maybe an encouraging thought ,LOTR1,False
1303, it i not  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
1304, though i am not sure that i understand you ,LOTR1,False
1305, but how have you learned all thi about the ring and about gollum ,LOTR1,False
1306, do you really know it all or are you just guessing still ,LOTR1,False
1307, gandalf looked at frodo and hi eye glinted ,LOTR1,False
1308, i knew much and i have learned much  he answered ,LOTR1,False
1309, but i am not going to give an account of all my doing to you ,LOTR1,False
1310, the history of elendil and isildur and the one ring i known to all the wise ,LOTR1,False
1311, your ring i shown to be that one ring by the fire writing alone apart from any other evidence ,LOTR1,False
1312, and when did you discover that ,LOTR1,False
1313, just now in thi room of course  answered the wizard sharply ,LOTR1,False
1314, but i expected to find it ,LOTR1,False
1315, i have come back from dark journey and long search to make that final test ,LOTR1,False
1316, it i the last proof and all i now only too clear ,LOTR1,False
1317, making out gollum part and fitting it into the gap in the history required some thought ,LOTR1,False
1318, i may have started with guesse about gollum but i am not guessing now ,LOTR1,False
1319, the obviou thing to do of course if one could ,LOTR1,False
1320, i tried long ago; but i have managed it at last ,LOTR1,False
1321, then what happened after bilbo escaped from him ,LOTR1,False
1322, what i have told you i what gollum wa willing to tell though not of course in the way i have reported it ,LOTR1,False
1323, gollum i a liar and you have to sift hi word ,LOTR1,False
1324, for instance he called the ring hi birthday present and he stuck to that ,LOTR1,False
1325, he said it came from hi grandmother who had lot of beautiful thing of that kind ,LOTR1,False
1326, i have no doubt that smjagol grandmother wa a matriarch a great person in her way but to talk of her possessing many elven ring wa absurd and a for giving them away it wa a lie ,LOTR1,False
1327, but a lie with a grain of truth ,LOTR1,False
1328, the murder of deal haunted gollum and he had made up a defence repeating it to hi precious over and over again a he gnawed bone in the dark until he almost believed it ,LOTR1,False
1329, deal ought to have given the ring to him ,LOTR1,False
1330, it had previously turned up just so a to be a present ,LOTR1,False
1331, it wa hi birthday present and so on and on ,LOTR1,False
1332, i endured him a long a i could but the truth wa desperately important and in the end i had to be harsh ,LOTR1,False
1333, i put the fear of fire on him and wrung the true story out of him bit by bit together with much snivelling and snarling ,LOTR1,False
1334, he thought he wa misunderstood and ill used ,LOTR1,False
1335, but when he had at last told me hi history a far a the end of the riddle game and bilbo escape he would not say any more except in dark hint ,LOTR1,False
1336, some other fear wa on him greater than mine ,LOTR1,False
1337, he muttered that he wa going to gel hi own back ,LOTR1,False
1338, people would see if he would stand being kicked and driven into a hole and then robbed ,LOTR1,False
1339, gollum had good friend now good friend and very strong ,LOTR1,False
1340, baggin would pay for it ,LOTR1,False
1341, that wa hi chief thought ,LOTR1,False
1342, he hated bilbo and cursed hi name ,LOTR1,False
1343, what i more he knew where he came from ,LOTR1,False
1344, but how did he find that out ,LOTR1,False
1345, well a for the name bilbo very foolishly told gollum himself; and after that it would not be difficult to discover hi country once gollum came out ,LOTR1,False
1346, oh ye he came out ,LOTR1,False
1347, hi longing for the ring proved stronger than hi fear of the ore or even of the light ,LOTR1,False
1348, after a year or two he left the mountain ,LOTR1,False
1349, you see though still bound by desire of it the ring wa no longer devouring him; he began to revive a little ,LOTR1,False
1350, he felt old terribly old yet l timid and he wa mortally hungry ,LOTR1,False
1351, light light of sun and moon he still feared and hated and he alway will i think; but he wa cunning ,LOTR1,False
1352, he found he could hide from daylight and moonshine and make hi way swiftly and softly by dead of night with hi pale cold eye and catch small frightened or unwary thing ,LOTR1,False
1353, he grew stronger and bolder with new food and new air ,LOTR1,False
1354, he found hi way into mirkwood a one would expect ,LOTR1,False
1355, i that where you found him ,LOTR1,False
1356, i saw him there  answered gandalf but before that he had wandered far following bilbo trail ,LOTR1,False
1357, it wa difficult to learn anything from him for certain for hi talk wa constantly interrupted by curse and threat ,LOTR1,False
1358, what had it got in it pocketses ,LOTR1,False
1359, it wouldnt say no preciou ,LOTR1,False
1360, it cheated first it did ,LOTR1,False
1361, we ought to have squeezed it ye preciou ,LOTR1,False
1362, that i a sample of hi talk ,LOTR1,False
1363, i dont suppose you want any more ,LOTR1,False
1364, i had weary day of it ,LOTR1,False
1365, but from hint dropped among the snarl i even gathered that hi padding feet had taken him at last to esgaroth and even to the street of dale listening secretly and peering ,LOTR1,False
1366, well the new of the great event went far and wide in wilderland and many had heard bilbo name and knew where he came from ,LOTR1,False
1367, we had made no secret of our return journey to hi home in the west ,LOTR1,False
1368, gollum sharp ear would soon learn what he wanted ,LOTR1,False
1369, then why didnt he track bilbo further ,LOTR1,False
1370, why didnt he come to the shire ,LOTR1,False
1371, ah  said gandalf now we come to it ,LOTR1,False
1372, i think gollum tried to ,LOTR1,False
1373, he set out and came back westward a far a the great river ,LOTR1,False
1374, but then he turned aside ,LOTR1,False
1375, he wa not daunted by the distance i am sure ,LOTR1,False
1376, no something else drew him away ,LOTR1,False
1377, so my friend think those that hunted him for me ,LOTR1,False
1378, the wood elve tracked him first an easy task for them for hi trail wa still fresh then ,LOTR1,False
1379, through mirkwood and back again it led them though they never caught him ,LOTR1,False
1380, the wood wa full of the rumour of him dreadful tale even among beast and bird ,LOTR1,False
1381, the woodmen said that there wa some new terror abroad a ghost that drank blood ,LOTR1,False
1382, it climbed tree to find nests; it crept into hole to find the young; it slipped through window to find cradle ,LOTR1,False
1383, but at the western edge of mirkwood the trail turned away ,LOTR1,False
1384, it wandered off southward and passed out of the wood elves ken and wa lost ,LOTR1,False
1385, and then i made a great mistake ,LOTR1,False
1386, ye frodo and not the first; though i fear it may prove the worst ,LOTR1,False
1387, i let the matter be ,LOTR1,False
1388, i let him go; for i had much else to think of at that time and i still trusted the lore of saruman ,LOTR1,False
1389, well that wa year ago ,LOTR1,False
1390, i have paid for it since with many dark and dangerou day ,LOTR1,False
1391, the trail wa long cold when i took it up again after bilbo left here ,LOTR1,False
1392, and my search would have been in vain but for the help that i had from a friend: aragorn the greatest traveller and huntsman of thi age of the world ,LOTR1,False
1393, together we sought for gollum down the whole length of wilderland without hope and without succ ,LOTR1,False
1394, but at last when i had given up the chase and turned to other part gollum wa found ,LOTR1,False
1395, my friend returned out of the great peril bringing the miserable creature with him ,LOTR1,False
1396, what he had been doing he would not say ,LOTR1,False
1397, he only wept and called u cruel with many a gollum in hi throat; and when we pressed him he whined and cringed and rubbed hi long hand licking hi finger a if they pained him a if he remembered some old torture ,LOTR1,False
1398, but i am afraid there i no possible doubt: he had made hi slow sneaking way step by step mile by mile south down at last to the land of mordor ,LOTR1,False
1399, a heavy silence fell in the room ,LOTR1,False
1400, frodo could hear hi heart beating ,LOTR1,False
1401, even outside everything seemed still ,LOTR1,False
1402, no sound of sam shear could now be heard ,LOTR1,False
1403, ye to mordor  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1404, mordor draw all wicked thing and the dark power wa bending all it will to gather them there ,LOTR1,False
1405, the ring of the enemy would leave it mark too leave him open to the summon ,LOTR1,False
1406, and all folk were whispering then of the new shadow in the south and it hatred of the west ,LOTR1,False
1407, there were hi fine new friend who would help him in hi revenge  ,LOTR1,False
1408, in that land he would learn much too much for hi comfort ,LOTR1,False
1409, and sooner or later a he lurked and pried on the border he would be caught and taken for examination ,LOTR1,False
1410, that wa the way of it i fear ,LOTR1,False
1411, when he wa found he had already been there long and wa on hi way back ,LOTR1,False
1412, on some errand of mischief ,LOTR1,False
1413, but that doe not matter much now ,LOTR1,False
1414, hi worst mischief wa done ,LOTR1,False
1415, through him the enemy ha learned that the one ha been found again ,LOTR1,False
1416, he know where isildur fell ,LOTR1,False
1417, he know where gollum found hi ring ,LOTR1,False
1418, he know that it i a great ring for it gave long life ,LOTR1,False
1419, he know that it i not one of the three for they have never been lost and they endure no evil ,LOTR1,False
1420, he know that it i not one of the seven or the nine for they are accounted for ,LOTR1,False
1421, he know that it i the one ,LOTR1,False
1422, and he ha at last heard i think of hobbit and the shire ,LOTR1,False
1423, the shire he may be seeking for it now if he ha not already found out where it lie ,LOTR1,False
1424, indeed frodo i fear that he may even think that the long unnoticed name of baggin ha become important ,LOTR1,False
1425, far worse than the worst that i imagined from your hint and warning ,LOTR1,False
1426, o gandalf best of friend what am i to do ,LOTR1,False
1427, for now i am really afraid ,LOTR1,False
1428, what am i to do ,LOTR1,False
1429, what a pity that bilbo did not stab that vile creature when he had a chance ,LOTR1,False
1430, it wa pity that stayed hi hand ,LOTR1,False
1431, pity and mercy: not to strike without need ,LOTR1,False
1432, and he ha been well rewarded frodo ,LOTR1,False
1433, be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil and escaped in the end because he began hi ownership of the ring so ,LOTR1,False
1434, i am sorry  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
1435, but i am frightened; and i do not feel any pity for gollum ,LOTR1,False
1436, you have not seen him  gandalf broke in ,LOTR1,False
1437, no and i dont want to  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
1438, do you mean to say that you and the elve have let him live on after all those horrible deeds ,LOTR1,False
1439, now at any rate he i a bad a an ore and just an enemy ,LOTR1,False
1440, many that live deserve death ,LOTR1,False
1441, and some that die deserve life ,LOTR1,False
1442, can you give it to them ,LOTR1,False
1443, then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement ,LOTR1,False
1444, for even the very wise cannot see all end ,LOTR1,False
1445, i have not much hope that gollum can be cured before he die but there i a chance of it ,LOTR1,False
1446, and he i bound up with the fate of the ring ,LOTR1,False
1447, my heart tell me that he ha some part to play yet for good or ill before the end; and when that come the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many your not least ,LOTR1,False
1448, in any case we did not kill him: he i very old and very wretched ,LOTR1,False
1449, the wood elve have him in prison but they treat him with such kindn a they can find in their wise heart ,LOTR1,False
1450, all the same  said frodo even if bilbo could not kill gollum i wish he had not kept the ring ,LOTR1,False
1451, i wish he had never found it and that i had not got it ,LOTR1,False
1452, why did you let me keep it ,LOTR1,False
1453, why didnt you make me throw it away or or destroy it ,LOTR1,False
1454, havent you been listening to all that i have said ,LOTR1,False
1455, you are not thinking of what you are saying ,LOTR1,False
1456, but a for throwing it away that wa obviously wrong ,LOTR1,False
1457, these ring have a way of being found ,LOTR1,False
1458, in evil hand it might have done great evil ,LOTR1,False
1459, worst of all it might have fallen into the hand of the enemy ,LOTR1,False
1460, indeed it certainly would; for thi i the one and he i exerting all hi power to find it or draw it to himself ,LOTR1,False
1461, of course my dear frodo it wa dangerou for you; and that ha troubled me deeply ,LOTR1,False
1462, but there wa so much at stake that i had to take some risk though even when i wa far away there ha never been a day when the shire ha not been guarded by watchful eye ,LOTR1,False
1463, a long a you never used it i did not think that the ring would have any lasting effect on you not for evil not at any rate for a very long time ,LOTR1,False
1464, and you must remember that nine year ago when i last saw you i still knew little for certain ,LOTR1,False
1465, but why not destroy it a you say should have been done long ago ,LOTR1,False
1466, if you had warned me or even sent me a message i would have done away with it ,LOTR1,False
1467, how would you do that ,LOTR1,False
1468, but i suppose one could hammer it or melt it ,LOTR1,False
1469, frodo drew the ring out of hi pocket again and looked at it ,LOTR1,False
1470, it now appeared plain and smooth without mark or device that he could see ,LOTR1,False
1471, the gold looked very fair and pure and frodo thought how rich and beautiful wa it colour how perfect wa it roundn ,LOTR1,False
1472, it wa an admirable thing and altogether preciou ,LOTR1,False
1473, when he took it out he had intended to fling it from him into the very hottest part of the fire ,LOTR1,False
1474, but he found now that he could not do so not without a great struggle ,LOTR1,False
1475, he weighed the ring in hi hand hesitating and forcing himself to remember all that gandalf had told him; and then with an effort of will he made a movement a if to cast it away but he found that he had put it back in hi pocket ,LOTR1,False
1476, already you too frodo cannot easily let it go nor will to damage it ,LOTR1,False
1477, and i could not make you except by force which would break your mind ,LOTR1,False
1478, but a for breaking the ring force i usel ,LOTR1,False
1479, even if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledge hammer it would make no dint in it ,LOTR1,False
1480, it cannot be unmade by your hand or by mine ,LOTR1,False
1481, your small fire of course would not melt even ordinary gold ,LOTR1,False
1482, thi ring ha already passed through it unscathed and even unheated ,LOTR1,False
1483, but there i no smith forge in thi shire that could change it at all ,LOTR1,False
1484, not even the anvil and furnace of the dwarve could do that ,LOTR1,False
1485, it ha been said that dragon fire could melt and consume the ring of power but there i not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire i hot enough; nor wa there ever any dragon not even ancalagon the black who could have harmed the one ring the ruling ring for that wa made by sauron himself ,LOTR1,False
1486, there i only one way: to find the crack of doom in the depth of orodruin the fire mountain and cast the ring in there if you really wish to destroy it to put it beyond the grasp of the enemy for ever ,LOTR1,False
1487, i do really wish to destroy it ,LOTR1,False
1488, or well to have it destroyed ,LOTR1,False
1489, i am not made for perilou quest ,LOTR1,False
1490, i wish i had never seen the ring  ,LOTR1,False
1491, why did it come to me ,LOTR1,False
1492, such question cannot be answered  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1493, you may be sure that it wa not for any merit that other do not possess: not for power or wisdom at any rate ,LOTR1,False
1494, but you have been chosen and you must therefore use such strength and heart and wit a you have ,LOTR1,False
1495, but i have so little of any of these things ,LOTR1,False
1496, you are wise and powerful ,LOTR1,False
1497, will you not take the ring ,LOTR1,False
1498, cried gandalf springing to hi feet ,LOTR1,False
1499, with that power i should have power too great and terrible ,LOTR1,False
1500, and over me the ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly ,LOTR1,False
1501, hi eye flashed and hi face wa lit a by a fire within ,LOTR1,False
1502, for i do not wish to become like the dark lord himself ,LOTR1,False
1503, yet the way of the ring to my heart i by pity pity for weakn and the desire of strength to do good ,LOTR1,False
1504, i dare not take it not even to keep it safe unused ,LOTR1,False
1505, the wish to wield it would be too great for my strength ,LOTR1,False
1506, i shall have such need of it ,LOTR1,False
1507, great peril lie before me ,LOTR1,False
1508, he went to the window and drew aside the curtain and the shutter ,LOTR1,False
1509, sunlight streamed back again into the room ,LOTR1,False
1510, sam passed along the path outside whistling ,LOTR1,False
1511, and now  said the wizard turning back to frodo the decision lie with you ,LOTR1,False
1512, but i will alway help you ,LOTR1,False
1513, he laid hi hand on frodo shoulder ,LOTR1,False
1514, i will help you bear thi burden a long a it i your to bear ,LOTR1,False
1515, but we must do something soon ,LOTR1,False
1516, there wa a long silence ,LOTR1,False
1517, gandalf sat down again and puffed at hi pipe a if lost in thought ,LOTR1,False
1518, hi eye seemed closed but under the lid he wa watching frodo intently ,LOTR1,False
1519, frodo gazed fixedly at the red ember on the hearth until they filled all hi vision and he seemed to be looking down into profound well of fire ,LOTR1,False
1520, he wa thinking of the fabled crack of doom and the terror of the fiery mountain ,LOTR1,False
1521, what are you thinking about ,LOTR1,False
1522, have you decided what to do ,LOTR1,False
1523, answered frodo coming back to himself out of darkn and finding to hi surprise that it wa not dark and that out of the window he could see the sunlit garden ,LOTR1,False
1524, a far a i understand what you have said i suppose i must keep the ring and guard it at least for the present whatever it may do to me ,LOTR1,False
1525, whatever it may do it will be slow slow to evil if you keep it with that purpose  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1526, i hope so  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
1527, but i hope that you may find some other better keeper soon ,LOTR1,False
1528, but in the meanwhile it seem that i am a danger a danger to all that live near me ,LOTR1,False
1529, i cannot keep the ring and stay here ,LOTR1,False
1530, i ought to leave bag end leave the shire leave everything and go away ,LOTR1,False
1531, i should like to save the shire if i could though there have been time when i thought the inhabitant too stupid and dull for word and have felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragon might be good for them ,LOTR1,False
1532, but i dont feel like that now ,LOTR1,False
1533, i feel that a long a the shire lie behind safe and comfortable i shall find wandering more bearable: i shall know that somewhere there i a firm foothold even if my feet cannot stand there again ,LOTR1,False
1534, of course i have sometime thought of going away but i imagined that a a kind of holiday a serie of adventure like bilbo or better ending in peace ,LOTR1,False
1535, but thi would mean exile a flight from danger into danger drawing it after me ,LOTR1,False
1536, and i suppose i must go alone if i am to do that and save the shire ,LOTR1,False
1537, but i feel very small and very uprooted and well desperate ,LOTR1,False
1538, the enemy i so strong and terrible ,LOTR1,False
1539, he did not tell gandalf but a he wa speaking a great desire to follow bilbo flamed up in hi heart to follow bilbo and even perhap to find him again ,LOTR1,False
1540, it wa so strong that it overcame hi fear: he could almost have run out there and then down the road without hi hat a bilbo had done on a similar morning long ago ,LOTR1,False
1541, hobbit really are amazing creature a i have said before ,LOTR1,False
1542, you can learn all that there i to know about their way in a month and yet after a hundred year they can still surprise you at a pinch ,LOTR1,False
1543, i hardly expected to get such an answer not even from you ,LOTR1,False
1544, but bilbo made no mistake in choosing hi heir though he little thought how important it would prove ,LOTR1,False
1545, i am afraid you are right ,LOTR1,False
1546, the ring will not be able to stay hidden in the shire much longer; and for your own sake a well a for other you will have to go and leave the name of baggin behind you ,LOTR1,False
1547, that name will not be safe to have outside the shire or in the wild ,LOTR1,False
1548, i will give you a travelling name now ,LOTR1,False
1549, when you go go a mr underhill ,LOTR1,False
1550, but i dont think you need go alone ,LOTR1,False
1551, not if you know of anyone you can trust and who would be willing to go by your side and that you would be willing to take into unknown peril ,LOTR1,False
1552, but if you look for a companion be careful in choosing ,LOTR1,False
1553, and be careful of what you say even to your closest friends ,LOTR1,False
1554, the enemy ha many spie and many way of hearing ,LOTR1,False
1555, suddenly he stopped a if listening ,LOTR1,False
1556, frodo became aware that all wa very quiet inside and outside ,LOTR1,False
1557, gandalf crept to one side of the window ,LOTR1,False
1558, then with a dart he sprang to the sill and thrust a long arm out and downward ,LOTR1,False
1559, there wa a squawk and up came sam gamgee curly head hauled by one ear ,LOTR1,False
1560, well well bl my beard ,LOTR1,False
1561, now what may you be doing ,LOTR1,False
1562, lor bl you mr gandalf sir ,LOTR1,False
1563, leastway i wa just trimming the grass border under the window if you follow me ,LOTR1,False
1564, he picked up hi shear and exhibited them a evidence ,LOTR1,False
1565, i dont  said gandalf grimly ,LOTR1,False
1566, it i some time since i last heard the sound of your shear ,LOTR1,False
1567, how long have you been eavesdropping ,LOTR1,False
1568, i dont follow you begging your pardon ,LOTR1,False
1569, there aint no eave at bag end and that a fact ,LOTR1,False
1570, what have you heard and why did you listen ,LOTR1,False
1571, gandalf eye flashed and hi brow stuck out like bristle ,LOTR1,False
1572, dont let him hurt me sir ,LOTR1,False
1573, dont let him turn me into anything unnatural ,LOTR1,False
1574, my old dad would take on so ,LOTR1,False
1575, i meant no harm on my honour sir ,LOTR1,False
1576, he wont hurt you  said frodo hardly able to keep from laughing although he wa himself startled and rather puzzled ,LOTR1,False
1577, he know a well a i do that you mean no harm ,LOTR1,False
1578, but just you up and answer hi question straight away ,LOTR1,False
1579, well sir  said sam dithering a little ,LOTR1,False
1580, i heard a deal that i didnt rightly understand about an enemy and ring and mr bilbo sir and dragon and a fiery mountain and and elve sir ,LOTR1,False
1581, i listened because i couldnt help myself if you know what i mean ,LOTR1,False
1582, lor bl me sir but i do love tale of that sort ,LOTR1,False
1583, and i believe them too whatever ted may say ,LOTR1,False
1584, i would dearly love to see them ,LOTR1,False
1585, couldnt you take me to see elve sir when you go ,LOTR1,False
1586, he shouted and putting out both hi arm he lifted the astonished sam shear grass clipping and all right through the window and stood him on the floor ,LOTR1,False
1587, take you to see elve eh ,LOTR1,False
1588, he said eyeing sam closely but with a smile flickering on hi face ,LOTR1,False
1589, so you heard that mr frodo i going away ,LOTR1,False
1590, and that why i choked: which you heard seemingly ,LOTR1,False
1591, i tried not to sir but it burst out of me: i wa so upset ,LOTR1,False
1592, it cant be helped sam  said frodo sadly ,LOTR1,False
1593, he had suddenly realized that flying from the shire would mean more painful parting than merely saying farewell to the familiar comfort of bag end ,LOTR1,False
1594, i shall have to go ,LOTR1,False
1595, but and here he looked hard at sam if you really care about me you will keep that dead secret ,LOTR1,False
1596, if you dont if you even breathe a word of what youve heard here then i hope gandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass snake ,LOTR1,False
1597, sam fell on hi knee trembling ,LOTR1,False
1598, i have thought of something better than that ,LOTR1,False
1599, something to shut your mouth and punish you properly for listening ,LOTR1,False
1600, you shall go away with mr frodo ,LOTR1,False
1601, cried sam springing up like a dog invited for a walk ,LOTR1,False
1602, me go and see elve and all ,LOTR1,False
1603, he shouted and then burst into tear ,LOTR1,False
1604, three i company you ought to go quietly and you ought to go soon  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1605, two or three week had passed and still frodo made no sign of getting ready to go i know ,LOTR1,False
1606, but it i difficult to do both  he objected ,LOTR1,False
1607, if i just vanish like bilbo the tale will be all over the shire in no time ,LOTR1,False
1608, of course you mustnt vanish ,LOTR1,False
1609, that wouldnt do at all ,LOTR1,False
1610, i said soon not instantly ,LOTR1,False
1611, if you can think of any way of slipping out of the shire without it being generally known it will be worth a little delay ,LOTR1,False
1612, but you must not delay too long ,LOTR1,False
1613, what about the autumn on or after our birthday ,LOTR1,False
1614, i think i could probably make some arrangement by then ,LOTR1,False
1615, to tell the truth he wa very reluctant to start now that it had come to the point ,LOTR1,False
1616, bag end seemed a more desirable residence than it had for year and he wanted to savour a much a he could of hi last summer in the shire ,LOTR1,False
1617, when autumn came he knew that part at least of hi heart would think more kindly of journeying a it alway did at that season ,LOTR1,False
1618, he had indeed privately made up hi mind to leave on hi fiftieth birthday: bilbo one hundred and twenty eighth ,LOTR1,False
1619, it seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and follow him ,LOTR1,False
1620, following bilbo wa uppermost in hi mind and the one thing that made the thought of leaving bearable ,LOTR1,False
1621, he thought a little a possible about the ring and where it might lead him in the end ,LOTR1,False
1622, but he did not tell all hi thought to gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1623, what the wizard guessed wa alway difficult to tell ,LOTR1,False
1624, he looked at frodo and smiled ,LOTR1,False
1625, very well  he said ,LOTR1,False
1626, i think that will do but it must not be any later ,LOTR1,False
1627, i am getting very anxiou ,LOTR1,False
1628, in the mean while do take care and dont let out any hint of where you are going ,LOTR1,False
1629, and see that sam gamgee doe not talk ,LOTR1,False
1630, if he doe i really shall turn him into a toad ,LOTR1,False
1631, a for where i am going  said frodo it would be difficult to give that away for i have no clear idea myself yet ,LOTR1,False
1632, i am not warning you against leaving an addr at the post office ,LOTR1,False
1633, but you are leaving the shire and that should not be known until you are far away ,LOTR1,False
1634, and you must go or at least set out either north south west or east and the direction should certainly not be known ,LOTR1,False
1635, i have been so taken up with the thought of leaving bag end and of saying farewell that i have never even considered the direction  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
1636, for where am i to go ,LOTR1,False
1637, and by what shall i steer ,LOTR1,False
1638, what i to be my quest ,LOTR1,False
1639, bilbo went to find a treasure there and back again; but i go to lose one and not return a far a i can see ,LOTR1,False
1640, but you cannot see very far  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1641, it may be your task to find the crack of doom; but that quest may be for others: i do not know ,LOTR1,False
1642, at any rate you are not ready for that long road yet ,LOTR1,False
1643, but in the meantime what course am i to lake ,LOTR1,False
1644, toward danger; but not too rashly nor too straight  answered the wizard ,LOTR1,False
1645, if you want my advice make for rivendell ,LOTR1,False
1646, that journey should not prove too perilou though the road i l easy than it wa and it will grow worse a the year fail ,LOTR1,False
1647, very good: i will go east and i will make for rivendell ,LOTR1,False
1648, i will take sam to visit the elves; he will be delighted ,LOTR1,False
1649, he spoke lightly; but hi heart wa moved suddenly with a desire to see the house of elrond halfelven and breathe the air of that deep valley where many of the fair folk still dwelt in peace ,LOTR1,False
1650, one summer evening an astonishing piece of new reached the ivy bush and green dragon ,LOTR1,False
1651, giant and other portent on the border of the shire were forgotten for more important matters: mr frodo wa selling bag end indeed he had already sold it to the sackville bagginses ,LOTR1,False
1652, for a nice bit loo  said some ,LOTR1,False
1653, at a bargain price  said other and that more likely when mistr fobelia the buyer ,LOTR1,False
1654, (otho had died some year before at the ripe but disappointed age of number ,LOTR1,False
1655,) just why mr frodo wa selling hi beautiful hole wa even more debatable than the price ,LOTR1,False
1656, a few held the theory supported by the nod and hint of mr baggin himself that frodo money wa running out: he wa going to leave hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceed of the sale down in buckland among hi brandybuck relation ,LOTR1,False
1657, a far from the sackville bagginse a may be  some added ,LOTR1,False
1658, but so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth of the bagginse of bag end become that most found thi hard to believe harder than any other reason or unreason that their fancy could suggest: to most it suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1659, though he kept himself very quiet and did not go about by day it wa well known that he wa hiding up in the bag end ,LOTR1,False
1660, but however a removal might fit in with the design of hi wizardry there wa no doubt about the fact: frodo baggin wa going back to buckland ,LOTR1,False
1661, ye i shall be moving thi autumn  he said ,LOTR1,False
1662, merry brandybuck i looking out for a nice little hole for me or perhap a small house ,LOTR1,False
1663, a a matter of fact with merry help he had already chosen and bought a little house at crickhollow in the country beyond bucklebury ,LOTR1,False
1664, to all but sam he pretended he wa going to settle down there permanently ,LOTR1,False
1665, the decision to set out eastward had suggested the idea to him; for buckland wa on the eastern border of the shire and a he had lived there in childhood hi going back would at least seem credible ,LOTR1,False
1666, gandalf stayed in the shire for over two month ,LOTR1,False
1667, then one evening at the end of june soon after frodo plan had been finally arranged he suddenly announced that he wa going off again next morning ,LOTR1,False
1668, only for a short while i hope  he said ,LOTR1,False
1669, but i am going down beyond the southern border to get some new if i can ,LOTR1,False
1670, i have been idle longer than i should ,LOTR1,False
1671, he spoke lightly but it seemed to frodo that he looked rather worried ,LOTR1,False
1672, well no; but i have heard something that ha made me anxiou and need looking into ,LOTR1,False
1673, if i think it necessary after all for you to get off at once i shall come back immediately or at least send word ,LOTR1,False
1674, in the meanwhile stick to your plan; but be more careful than ever especially of the ring ,LOTR1,False
1675, fet me impr on you once more: dont use it ,LOTR1,False
1676, he went off at dawn ,LOTR1,False
1677, i may be back any day  he said ,LOTR1,False
1678, at the very latest i shall come back for the farewell party ,LOTR1,False
1679, i think after all you may need my company on the road ,LOTR1,False
1680, at first frodo wa a good deal disturbed and wondered often what gandalf could have heard; but hi uneasin wore off and in the fine weather he forgot hi trouble for a while ,LOTR1,False
1681, the shire had seldom seen so fair a summer or so rich an autumn: the tree were laden with apple honey wa dripping in the comb and the corn wa tall and full ,LOTR1,False
1682, autumn wa well under way before frodo began to worry about gandalf again ,LOTR1,False
1683, september wa passing and there wa still no new of him ,LOTR1,False
1684, the birthday and the removal drew nearer and still he did not come or send word ,LOTR1,False
1685, bag end began to be busy ,LOTR1,False
1686, some of frodo friend came to stay and help him with the packing: there wa fredegar bolger and folco boffin and of course hi special friend pippin took and merry brandybuck ,LOTR1,False
1687, between them they turned the whole place upside down ,LOTR1,False
1688, on september numberth two covered cart went off laden to buckland conveying the furniture and good that frodo had not sold to hi new home by way of the brandywine bridge ,LOTR1,False
1689, the next day frodo became really anxiou and kept a constant look out for gandalf ,LOTR1,False
1690, thursday hi birthday morning dawned a fair and clear a it had long ago for bilbo great party ,LOTR1,False

1692, in the evening frodo gave hi farewell feast: it wa quite small just a dinner for himself and hi four helpers; but he wa troubled and fell in no mood for it ,LOTR1,False
1693, the thought that he would so soon have to part with hi young friend weighed on hi heart ,LOTR1,False
1694, he wondered how he would break it to them ,LOTR1,False
1695, the four younger hobbit were however in high spirit and the party soon became very cheerful in spite of gandalf absence ,LOTR1,False
1696, the dining room wa bare except for a table and chair but the food wa good and there wa good wine: frodo wine had not been included in the sale to the sackville bagginse ,LOTR1,False

1718, it wa not polite; nor strictly true for the sale of bag end did not take effect until midnight ,LOTR1,False
1719, but lobelia can perhap be forgiven: she had been obliged to wait about seventy seven year longer for bag end than she once hoped and she wa now a hundred year old ,LOTR1,False
1720, anyway she had come to see that nothing she had paid for had been carried off; and she wanted the key ,LOTR1,False
1721, it took a long while to satisfy her a she had brought a complete inventory with her and went right through it ,LOTR1,False
1722, in the end she departed with lotho and the spare key and the promise that the other key would be left at the gamgees in bagshot row ,LOTR1,False
1723, she snorted and showed plainly that she thought the gamgee capable of plundering the hole during the night ,LOTR1,False
1724, frodo did not offer her any tea ,LOTR1,False
1725, he took hi own tea with pippin and sam gamgee in the kitchen ,LOTR1,False
1726, it had been officially announced that sam wa coming to buckland to do for mr frodo and look after hi bit of garden; an arrangement that wa approved by the gaffer though it did not console him for the prospect of having lobelia a a neighbour ,LOTR1,False

1734, it grew slowly dark indoor ,LOTR1,False
1735, he went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path and then on a short way down the hill road ,LOTR1,False

1741, i am going to start and gandalf must follow me ,LOTR1,False
1742, he turned to go back and then slopped for he heard voice just round the corner by the end of bagshot row ,LOTR1,False
1743, one voice wa certainly the old gaffers; the other wa strange and somehow unpleasant ,LOTR1,False
1744, he could not make out what it said but he heard the gaffer answer which were rather shrill ,LOTR1,False

1753, no i cant give no message ,LOTR1,False
1754, footstep went away down the hill ,LOTR1,False
1755, frodo wondered vaguely why the fact that they did not come on up the hill seemed a great relief ,LOTR1,False
1756, i am sick of question and curiosity about my doing i suppose  he thought ,LOTR1,False
1757, what an inquisitive lot they all are ,LOTR1,False
1758, he had half a mind to go and ask the gaffer who the inquirer was; but he thought better (or worse) of it and turned and walked quickly back to bag end ,LOTR1,False
1759, pippin wa sitting on hi pack in the porch ,LOTR1,False
1760, frodo stepped inside the dark door ,LOTR1,False
1761, came the answer from far within followed soon by sam himself wiping hi mouth ,LOTR1,False
1762, he had been saying farewell to the beer barrel in the cellar ,LOTR1,False
1763, ill last for a bit now sir ,LOTR1,False
1764, frodo shut and locked the round door and gave the key to sam ,LOTR1,False
1765, run down with thi to your home sam ,LOTR1,False
1766, then cut along the row and meet u a quick a you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadow ,LOTR1,False
1767, we are not going through the village tonight ,LOTR1,False
1768, too many ear pricking and eye prying ,LOTR1,False
1769, sam ran off at full speed ,LOTR1,False
1770, well now were off at last ,LOTR1,False
1771, they shouldered their pack and took up their stick and walked round the corner to the west side of bag end ,LOTR1,False
1772, said frodo looking at the dark blank window ,LOTR1,False
1773, he waved hi hand and then turned and (following bilbo if he had known it) hurried after peregrin down the garden path ,LOTR1,False
1774, they jumped over the low place in the hedge at the bottom and took to the field passing into the darkn like a rustle in the grasse ,LOTR1,False
1775, at the bottom of the hill on it western side they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane ,LOTR1,False
1776, there they halted and adjusted the strap of their pack ,LOTR1,False
1777, presently sam appeared trotting quickly and breathing hard; hi heavy pack wa hoisted high on hi shoulder and he had put on hi head a tall shapel fell bag which he called a hat ,LOTR1,False
1778, in the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf ,LOTR1,False
1779, i am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
1780, i pity snail and all that carry their home on their back ,LOTR1,False

1790, he picked up hi stick again ,LOTR1,False
1791, well we all like walking in the dark  he said so let put some mile behind u before bed ,LOTR1,False
1792, for a short way they followed the lane westward ,LOTR1,False
1793, then leaving it they turned left and took quietly to the field again ,LOTR1,False
1794, they went in single file along hedgerow and the border of coppice and night fell dark about them ,LOTR1,False
1795, in their dark cloak they were a invisible a if they all had magic ring ,LOTR1,False
1796, since they were all hobbit and were trying to be silent they made no noise that even hobbit would hear ,LOTR1,False
1797, even the wild thing in the field and wood hardly noticed their passing ,LOTR1,False
1798, after some time they crossed the water west of hobbiton by a narrow plank bridge ,LOTR1,False
1799, the stream wa there no more than a winding black ribbon bordered with leaning alder tree ,LOTR1,False
1800, a mile or two further south they hastily crossed the great road from the brandywine bridge; they were now in the tookland and bending south eastward they made for the green hill country ,LOTR1,False
1801, a they began to climb it first slope they looked back and saw the lamp in hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the water ,LOTR1,False
1802, soon it disappeared in the fold of the darkened land and wa followed by by water beside it grey pool ,LOTR1,False
1803, when the light of the last farm wa far behind peeping among the tree frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell ,LOTR1,False
1804, i wonder if i shall ever look down into that valley again  he said quietly ,LOTR1,False
1805, when they had walked for about three hour they rested ,LOTR1,False
1806, the night wa clear cool and starry but smoke like wisp of mist were creeping up the hill side from the stream and deep meadow ,LOTR1,False
1807, thin clad birche swaying in a light wind above their head made a black net against the pale sky ,LOTR1,False
1808, they ate a very frugal supper (for hobbits) and then went on again ,LOTR1,False
1809, soon they struck a narrow road that went rolling up and down fading grey into the darkn ahead: the road to woodhall and stock and the bucklebury ferry ,LOTR1,False
1810, it climbed away from the main road in the water valley and wound over the skirt of the green hill toward woody end a wild corner of the eastfarthing ,LOTR1,False
1811, after a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall tree that rustled their dry leave in the night ,LOTR1,False
1812, at first they talked or hummed a tune softly together being now far away from inquisitive ear ,LOTR1,False
1813, then they marched on in silence and pippin began to lag behind ,LOTR1,False
1814, at last a they began to climb a steep slope he stopped and yawned ,LOTR1,False
1815, i am so sleepy  he said that soon i shall fall down on the road ,LOTR1,False
1816, are you going to sleep on your legs ,LOTR1,False
1817, i thought you liked walking in the dark  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
1818, but there i no great hurry ,LOTR1,False
1819, merry expect u some time the day after tomorrow; but that leave u nearly two day more ,LOTR1,False
1820, well halt at the first likely spot ,LOTR1,False
1821, the wind in the west  said sam ,LOTR1,False
1822, if we get to the other side of thi hill we shall find a spot that i sheltered and snug enough sir ,LOTR1,False
1823, there i a dry fir wood just ahead if i remember rightly ,LOTR1,False
1824, sam knew the land well within twenty mile of hobbiton but that wa the limit of hi geography ,LOTR1,False
1825, just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir wood ,LOTR1,False
1826, leaving the road they went into the deep resin scented darkn of the tree and gathered dead stick and cone to make a fire ,LOTR1,False
1827, soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir tree and they sat round it for a while until they began to nod ,LOTR1,False
1828, then each in an angle of the great tree root they curled up in their cloak and blanket and were soon fast asleep ,LOTR1,False
1829, they set no watch; even frodo feared no danger yet for they were still in the heart of the shire ,LOTR1,False
1830, a few creature came and looked at them when the fire had died away ,LOTR1,False
1831, a fox passing through the wood on busin of hi own stopped several minute and sniffed ,LOTR1,False
1832, i have heard of strange doing in thi land but i have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of door under a tree ,LOTR1,False
1833, there something mighty queer behind thi ,LOTR1,False
1834, he wa quite right but he never found out any more about it ,LOTR1,False
1835, the morning came pale and clammy ,LOTR1,False
1836, frodo woke up first and found that a tree root had made a hole in hi back and that hi neck wa stiff ,LOTR1,False
1837, he thought a he usually did at the beginning of an expedition ,LOTR1,False
1838, and all my beautiful feather bed are sold to the sackville bagginses ,LOTR1,False
1839, these tree root would do them good ,LOTR1,False
1840, said pippin peering over the edge of hi blanket with one eye ,LOTR1,False
1841, gel breakfast ready for half past nine ,LOTR1,False
1842, have you got the bath water hot ,LOTR1,False
1843, sam jumped up looking rather bleary ,LOTR1,False
1844, no sir i havent sir ,LOTR1,False
1845, frodo stripped the blanket from pippin and rolled him over and then walked off to the edge of the wood ,LOTR1,False
1846, away eastward the sun wa rising red out of the mist that lay thick on the world ,LOTR1,False
1847, touched with gold and red the autumn tree seemed to be sailing rootl in a shadowy sea ,LOTR1,False
1848, a little below him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared ,LOTR1,False
1849, when he returned sam and pippin had got a good fire going ,LOTR1,False
1850, i dont keep water in my pocket  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
1851, we thought you had gone to find some  said pippin busy setting out the food and cup ,LOTR1,False
1852, you had better go now ,LOTR1,False
1853, you can come too  said frodo and bring all the water bottle ,LOTR1,False
1854, there wa a stream at the foot of the hill ,LOTR1,False
1855, they filled their bottle and the small camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell a few feet over an outcrop of grey stone ,LOTR1,False
1856, it wa icy cold; and they spluttered and puffed a they bathed their face and hand ,LOTR1,False
1857, when their breakfast wa over and their pack all trussed up again it wa after ten oclock and the day wa beginning to turn fine and hot ,LOTR1,False
1858, they went down the slope and acros the stream where it dived under the road and up the next slope and up and down another shoulder of the hills; and by that time their cloak blanket water food and other gear already seemed a heavy burden ,LOTR1,False
1859, the day march promised to be warm and tiring work ,LOTR1,False
1860, after some mile however the road ceased to roll up and down: it climbed to the top of a steep bank in a weary zig zagging sort of way and then prepared to go down for the last time ,LOTR1,False
1861, in front of them they saw the lower land dotted with small clump of tree that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland haze ,LOTR1,False
1862, they were looking acros the woody end toward the brandywine river ,LOTR1,False
1863, the road wound away before them like a piece of string ,LOTR1,False
1864, the road goe on for ever  said pippin; but i cant without a rest ,LOTR1,False
1865, it i high time for lunch ,LOTR1,False
1866, he sat down on the bank at the side of the road and looked away east into the haze beyond which lay the river and the end of the shire in which he had spent all hi life ,LOTR1,False
1867, hi round eye were wide open for he wa looking acros land he had never seen to a new horizon ,LOTR1,False
1868, do elve live in those woods ,LOTR1,False
1869, not that i ever heard  said pippin ,LOTR1,False
1870, he too wa gazing eastward along the road a if he had never seen it before ,LOTR1,False
1871, suddenly he spoke aloud but a if to himself saying slowly: the road goe ever on and on down from the door where it began ,LOTR1,False
1872, now far ahead the road ha gone and i must follow if i can pursuing it with weary feet until it join some larger way where many path and errand meet ,LOTR1,False
1873, that sound like a bit of old bilbo rhyming  said pippin ,LOTR1,False
1874, or i it one of your imitations ,LOTR1,False
1875, it doe not sound altogether encouraging ,LOTR1,False
1876, i dont know  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
1877, it came to me then a if i wa making it up; but i may have heard it long ago ,LOTR1,False
1878, certainly it remind me very much of bilbo in the last year before he went away ,LOTR1,False
1879, he used often to say there wa only one road; that it wa like a great river: it spring were at every doorstep and every path wa it tributary ,LOTR1,False
1880, it a dangerou busin frodo going out of your door he used to say ,LOTR1,False
1881, you step into the road and if you dont keep your feet there i no knowing where you might be swept off to ,LOTR1,False
1882, do you realize that thi i the very path that goe through mirkwood and that if you let it it might take you to the lonely mountain or even further and to worse places ,LOTR1,False
1883, he used to say that on the path outside the front door at bag end especially after he had been out for a long walk ,LOTR1,False
1884, well the road wont sweep me anywhere for an hour at least  said pippin unslinging hi pack ,LOTR1,False
1885, the other followed hi example putting their pack against the bank and their leg out into the road ,LOTR1,False
1886, after a rest they had a good lunch and then more rest ,LOTR1,False
1887, the sun wa beginning to get low and the light of afternoon wa on the land a they went down the hill ,LOTR1,False
1888, so far they had not met a soul on the road ,LOTR1,False
1889, thi way wa not much used being hardly fit for cart and there wa little traffic to the woody end ,LOTR1,False
1890, they had been jogging along again for an hour or more when sam stopped a moment a if listening ,LOTR1,False
1891, they were now on level ground and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through grass land sprinkled with tall tree outlier of the approaching wood ,LOTR1,False
1892, i can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind  said sam ,LOTR1,False
1893, they looked back but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far ,LOTR1,False
1894, i wonder if that i gandalf coming after u  said frodo; but even a he said it he had a feeling that it wa not so and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him ,LOTR1,False
1895, it may not matter much  he said apologetically but i would rather not be seen on the road by anyone ,LOTR1,False
1896, i am sick of my doing being noticed and discussed ,LOTR1,False
1897, and if it i gandalf  he added a an afterthought we can give him a little surprise to pay him out for being so late ,LOTR1,False
1898, let get out of sight ,LOTR1,False
1899, the other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not far from the road ,LOTR1,False
1900, frodo hesitated for a second: curiosity or some other feeling wa struggling with hi desire to hide ,LOTR1,False
1901, the sound of hoof drew nearer ,LOTR1,False
1902, just in time he threw himself down in a patch of long gras behind a tree that overshadowed the road ,LOTR1,False
1903, then he lifted hi head and peered cautiously above one of the great root ,LOTR1,False
1904, round the corner came a black horse no hobbit pony but a full sized horse; and on it sat a large man who seemed to crouch in the saddle wrapped in a great black cloak and hood so that only hi boot in the high stirrup showed below; hi face wa shadowed and invisible ,LOTR1,False
1905, when it reached the tree and wa level with frodo the horse stopped ,LOTR1,False
1906, the riding figure sat quite still with it head bowed a if listening ,LOTR1,False
1907, from inside the hood came a noise a of someone sniffing to catch an elusive scent; the head turned from side to side of the road ,LOTR1,False
1908, a sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of frodo and he thought of hi ring ,LOTR1,False
1909, he hardly dared to breathe and yet the desire to get it out of hi pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move hi hand ,LOTR1,False
1910, he felt that he had only to slip it on and then he would be safe ,LOTR1,False
1911, the advice of gandalf seemed absurd ,LOTR1,False
1912, bilbo had used the ring ,LOTR1,False
1913, and i am still in the shire  he thought a hi hand touched the chain on which it hung ,LOTR1,False
1914, at that moment the rider sat up and shook the rein ,LOTR1,False
1915, the horse stepped forward walking slowly at first and then breaking into a quick trot ,LOTR1,False
1916, frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider until he dwindled into the distance ,LOTR1,False
1917, he could not be quite sure but it seemed to him that suddenly before it passed out of sight the horse turned aside and went into the tree on the right ,LOTR1,False
1918, well i call that very queer and indeed disturbing  said frodo to himself a he walked toward hi companion ,LOTR1,False
1919, pippin and sam had remained flat in the gras and had seen nothing; so frodo described the rider and hi strange behaviour ,LOTR1,False
1920, i cant say why but i felt certain he wa looking or smelling for me; and also i felt certain that i did not want him to discover me ,LOTR1,False
1921, ive never seen or fell anything like it in the shire before ,LOTR1,False

1953, i might have been more careful on the road ,LOTR1,False
1954, still there may be no connexion between thi rider and the gaffer stranger  said pippin ,LOTR1,False
1955, we left hobbiton secretly enough and i dont see how he could have followed u ,LOTR1,False

2091, it i some mile but you shall have rest at the end of it and it will shorten your journey tomorrow ,LOTR1,False
2092, they now marched on again in silence and passed like shadow and faint lights: for elve (even more than hobbits) could walk when they wished without sound or footfall ,LOTR1,False
2093, pippin soon began to feel sleepy and staggered once or twice; but each time a tall elf at hi side put out hi arm and saved him from a fall ,LOTR1,False
2094, sam walked along at frodo side a if in a dream with an expression on hi face half of fear and half of astonished joy ,LOTR1,False
2095, the wood on either side became denser; the tree were now younger and thicker; and a the lane went lower running down into a fold of the hill there were many deep brake of hazel on the rising slope at either hand ,LOTR1,False
2096, at last the elve turned aside from the path ,LOTR1,False
2097, a green ride lay almost unseen through the thicket on the right; and thi they followed a it wound away back up the wooded slope on to the top of a shoulder of the hill that stood out into the lower land of the river valley ,LOTR1,False
2098, suddenly they came out of the shadow of the tree and before them lay a wide space of gras grey under the night ,LOTR1,False
2099, on three side the wood pressed upon it; but eastward the ground fell steeply and the top of the dark tree growing at the bottom of the slope were below their feet ,LOTR1,False
2100, beyond the low land lay dim and flat under the star ,LOTR1,False
2101, nearer at hand a few light twinkled in the village of woodhall ,LOTR1,False

2117, in the middle there wa a wood fire blazing and upon the tree pillar torche with light of gold and silver were burning steadily ,LOTR1,False
2118, the elve sat round the fire upon the gras or upon the sawn ring of old trunk ,LOTR1,False
2119, some went to and fro bearing cup and pouring drink; other brought food on heaped plate and dishe ,LOTR1,False
2120, thi i poor fare  they said to the hobbits; for we are lodging in the greenwood far from our hall ,LOTR1,False
2121, if ever you are our guest at home we will treat you better ,LOTR1,False
2122, it seem to me good enough for a birthday party  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
2123, pippin afterward recalled little of either food or drink for hi mind wa filled with the light upon the elf face and the sound of voice so variou and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream ,LOTR1,False
2124, but he remembered that there wa bread surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to one who i starving; and fruit sweet a wildberrie and richer than the tended fruit of gardens; he drained a cup that wa filled with a fragrant draught cool a a clear fountain golden a a summer afternoon ,LOTR1,False
2125, sam could never describe in word nor picture clearly to himself what he felt or thought that night though it remained in hi memory a one of the chief event of hi life ,LOTR1,False
2126, the nearest he ever got wa to say: well sir if i could grow apple like that i would call myself a gardener ,LOTR1,False
2127, but it wa the singing that went to my heart if you know what i mean ,LOTR1,False
2128, frodo sat eating drinking and talking with delight; but hi mind wa chiefly on the word spoken ,LOTR1,False
2129, he knew a little of the elf speech and listened eagerly ,LOTR1,False
2130, now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in their own language ,LOTR1,False
2131, they smiled at him and said laughing: here i a jewel among hobbits ,LOTR1,False
2132, after a while pippin fell fast asleep and wa lifted up and borne away to a bower under the trees; there he wa laid upon a soft bed and slept the rest of the night away ,LOTR1,False
2133, sam refused to leave hi master ,LOTR1,False
2134, when pippin had gone he came and sat curled up at frodo feet where at last he nodded and closed hi eye ,LOTR1,False
2135, frodo remained long awake talking with gildor ,LOTR1,False
2136, they spoke of many thing old and new and frodo questioned gildor much about happening in the wide world outside the shire ,LOTR1,False
2137, the tiding were mostly sad and ominous: of gathering darkn the war of men and the flight of the elve ,LOTR1,False
2138, at last frodo asked the question that wa nearest to hi heart: tell me gildor have you ever seen bilbo since he left us ,LOTR1,False
2139, he said farewell to u on thi very spot ,LOTR1,False
2140, but i saw him once again far from here ,LOTR1,False
2141, he would say no more about bilbo and frodo fell silent ,LOTR1,False
2142, you do not ask me or tell me much that concern yourself frodo  said gildor ,LOTR1,False
2143, but i already know a little and i can read more in your face and in the thought behind your question ,LOTR1,False
2144, you are leaving the shire and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek or accomplish what you intend or that you will ever return ,LOTR1,False
2145, it i  said frodo; but i thought my going wa a secret known only to gandalf and my faithful sam ,LOTR1,False
2146, he looked down at sam who wa snoring gently ,LOTR1,False
2147, the secret will not reach the enemy from u  said gildor ,LOTR1,False
2148, then you know why i am leaving the shire ,LOTR1,False
2149, i do not know for what reason the enemy i pursuing you  answered gildor; but i perceive that he i strange indeed though that seem to me ,LOTR1,False
2150, and i warn you that peril i now both before you and behind you and upon either side ,LOTR1,False
2151, i feared that they were servant of the enemy ,LOTR1,False
2152, what are the black riders ,LOTR1,False
2153, ha gandalf told you nothing ,LOTR1,False
2154, then i think it i not for me to say more lest terror should keep you from your journey ,LOTR1,False
2155, for it seem to me that you have set out only just in time if indeed you are in time ,LOTR1,False
2156, you must now make haste and neither stay nor turn back; for the shire i no longer any protection to you ,LOTR1,False
2157, i cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying than your hint and warning  exclaimed frodo ,LOTR1,False
2158, i knew that danger lay ahead of course; but i did not expect to meet it in our own shire ,LOTR1,False
2159, cant a hobbit walk from the water to the river in peace ,LOTR1,False
2160, but it i not your own shire  said gildor ,LOTR1,False
2161, other dwelt here before hobbit were; and other will dwell here again when hobbit are no more ,LOTR1,False
2162, the wide world i all about you: you can fence yourselve in but you cannot for ever fence it out ,LOTR1,False
2163, i know and yet it ha alway seemed so safe and familiar ,LOTR1,False
2164, what can i do now ,LOTR1,False
2165, my plan wa to leave the shire secretly and make my way to rivendell; but now my footstep are dogged before ever i get to buckland ,LOTR1,False
2166, i think you should still follow that plan  said gildor ,LOTR1,False
2167, i do not think the road will prove too hard for your courage ,LOTR1,False
2168, but if you desire clearer counsel you should ask gandalf ,LOTR1,False
2169, i do not know the reason for your flight and therefore i do not know by what mean your pursuer will assail you ,LOTR1,False
2170, these thing gandalf must know ,LOTR1,False
2171, i suppose that you will see him before you leave the shire ,LOTR1,False
2172, but that i another thing that make me anxiou ,LOTR1,False
2173, i have been expecting gandalf for many day ,LOTR1,False
2174, he wa to have come to hobbiton at the latest two night ago; but he ha never appeared ,LOTR1,False
2175, now i am wondering what can have happened ,LOTR1,False
2176, should i wait for him ,LOTR1,False
2177, gildor wa silent for a moment ,LOTR1,False
2178, i do not like thi new  he said at last ,LOTR1,False
2179, that gandalf should be late doe not bode well ,LOTR1,False
2180, but it i said: do not meddle in the affair of wizard for they are subtle and quick to anger ,LOTR1,False
2181, the choice i yours: to go or wait ,LOTR1,False
2182, and it i also said  answered frodo: go not to the elve for counsel for they will say both no and ye ,LOTR1,False
2183, elve seldom give unguarded advice for advice i a dangerou gift even from the wise to the wise and all course may run ill ,LOTR1,False
2184, you have not told me all concerning yourself; and how then shall i choose better than you ,LOTR1,False
2185, but if you demand advice i will for friendship sake give it ,LOTR1,False
2186, i think you should now go at once without delay; and if gandalf doe not come before you set out then i also advise this: do not go alone ,LOTR1,False
2187, take such friend a are trusty and willing ,LOTR1,False
2188, now you should be grateful for i do not give thi counsel gladly ,LOTR1,False
2189, the elve have their own labour and their own sorrow and they are little concerned with the way of hobbit or of any other creature upon earth ,LOTR1,False
2190, our path cros their seldom by chance or purpose ,LOTR1,False
2191, in thi meeting there may be more than chance; but the purpose i not clear to me and i fear to say too much ,LOTR1,False
2192, i am deeply grateful  said frodo; but i wish you would tell me plainly what the black rider are ,LOTR1,False
2193, if i take your advice i may not see gandalf for a long while and i ought to know what i the danger that pursue me ,LOTR1,False
2194, i it not enough to know that they are servant of the enemy ,LOTR1,False
2195, speak no word to them ,LOTR1,False
2196, ask no more of me ,LOTR1,False
2197, but my heart forbode that ere all i ended you frodo son of drogo will know more of these fell thing than gildor inglorion ,LOTR1,False
2198, but where shall i find courage ,LOTR1,False
2199, that i what i chiefly need ,LOTR1,False
2200, courage i found in unlikely place  said gildor ,LOTR1,False
2201, in the morning we shall have gone; but we will send our message through the land ,LOTR1,False
2202, the wandering companie shall know of your journey and those that have power for good shall be on the watch ,LOTR1,False
2203, i name you elf friend; and may the star shine upon the end of your road ,LOTR1,False
2204, seldom have we had such delight in stranger and it i fair to hear word of the ancient speech from the lip of other wanderer in the world ,LOTR1,False
2205, frodo felt sleep coming upon him even a gildor finished speaking ,LOTR1,False
2206, i will sleep now  he said; and the elf led him to a bower beside pippin and he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreaml slumber ,LOTR1,False
2207, a short cut to mushroom in the morning frodo woke refreshed ,LOTR1,False

2221, do you think we shall see anything of those riders ,LOTR1,False
2222, under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of them did not seem very alarming to him ,LOTR1,False
2223, ye probably  said frodo not liking the reminder ,LOTR1,False
2224, but i hope to get acros the river without their seeing u ,LOTR1,False
2225, did you find out anything about them from gildor ,LOTR1,False

2228, we didnt discus it  said frodo with hi mouth full ,LOTR1,False
2229, i am sure it i very important ,LOTR1,False
2230, in that case i am sure gildor would have refused to explain it  said frodo sharply ,LOTR1,False
2231, and now leave me in peace for a bit ,LOTR1,False
2232, i dont want to answer a string of question while i am eating ,LOTR1,False
2233, he walked away toward the edge of the green ,LOTR1,False
2234, from frodo mind the bright morning treacherously bright he thought had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the word of gildor ,LOTR1,False
2235, the merry voice of pippin came to him ,LOTR1,False
2236, he wa running on the green turf and singing ,LOTR1,False
2237, it i one thing to take my young friend walking over the shire with me until we are hungry and weary and food and bed are sweet ,LOTR1,False
2238, to take them into exile where hunger and wearin may have no cure i quite another even if they are willing to come ,LOTR1,False
2239, the inheritance i mine alone ,LOTR1,False
2240, i dont think i ought even to take sam ,LOTR1,False

2247, i am going with him if he climb to the moon and if any of those black ruler try to stop him theyll have sam gamgee to reckon with i said ,LOTR1,False
2248, who are they and what are you talking about ,LOTR1,False
2249, we had some talk last night; and they seemed to know you were going away so i didnt see the use of denying it ,LOTR1,False
2250, they are  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
2251, do you like them still now you have had a closer view ,LOTR1,False
2252, they seem a bit above my like and dislike so to speak  answered sam slowly ,LOTR1,False
2253, it dont seem to matter what i think about them ,LOTR1,False
2254, they are quite different from what i expected so old and young and so gay and sad a it were ,LOTR1,False
2255, frodo looked at sam rather startled half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him ,LOTR1,False
2256, it did not sound like the voice of the old sam gamgee that he thought he knew ,LOTR1,False
2257, but it looked like the old sam gamgee sitting there except that hi face wa unusually thoughtful ,LOTR1,False
2258, do you feel any need to leave the shire now now that your wish to see them ha come true already ,LOTR1,False
2259, i dont know how to say it but after last night i feel different ,LOTR1,False
2260, i seem to see ahead in a kind of way ,LOTR1,False
2261, i know we are going to take a very long road into darkness; but i know i cant turn back ,LOTR1,False
2262, it isnt to see elve now nor dragon nor mountain that i want number dont rightly know what i want: but i have something to do before the end and it lie ahead not in the shire ,LOTR1,False
2263, i must see it through sir if you understand me ,LOTR1,False
2264, but i understand that gandalf chose me a good companion ,LOTR1,False
2265, frodo finished hi breakfast in silence ,LOTR1,False
2266, then standing up he looked over the land ahead and called to pippin ,LOTR1,False
2267, he said a pippin ran up ,LOTR1,False
2268, we must be getting off at once ,LOTR1,False
2269, we slept late; and there are a good many mile to go ,LOTR1,False
2270, you slept late you mean  said pippin ,LOTR1,False
2271, i wa up long before; and we are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking ,LOTR1,False
2272, i have finished both now ,LOTR1,False
2273, and i am going to make for bucklebury ferry a quickly a possible ,LOTR1,False
2274, i am not going out of the way back to the road we left last night: i am going to cut straight acros country from here ,LOTR1,False
2275, then you are going to fly  said pippin ,LOTR1,False
2276, you wont cut straight on foot anywhere in thi country ,LOTR1,False
2277, we can cut straighter than the road anyway  answered frodo ,LOTR1,False
2278, the ferry i east from woodhall; but the hard road curve away to the left you can see a bend of it away north over there ,LOTR1,False
2279, it goe round the north end of the marish so a to strike the causeway from the bridge above stock ,LOTR1,False
2280, but that i mile out of the way ,LOTR1,False
2281, we could save a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the ferry from where we stand ,LOTR1,False
2282, short cut make long delay  argued pippin ,LOTR1,False
2283, the country i rough round here and there are bog and all kind of difficultie down in the marish i know the land in these part ,LOTR1,False
2284, and if you are worrying about black rider i cant see that it i any worse meeting them on a road than in a wood or a field ,LOTR1,False
2285, it i l easy to find people in the wood and field  answered frodo ,LOTR1,False
2286, and if you are supposed to be on the road there i some chance that you will be looked for on the road and not off it ,LOTR1,False
2287, i will follow you into every bog and ditch ,LOTR1,False
2288, i had counted on passing the golden perch at stock before sundown ,LOTR1,False
2289, the best beer in the eastfarthing or used to be: it i a long time since i tasted it ,LOTR1,False
2290, short cut make delay but inn make longer one ,LOTR1,False
2291, at all cost we must keep you away from the golden perch ,LOTR1,False
2292, we want to get to bucklebury before dark ,LOTR1,False
2293, what do you say sam ,LOTR1,False
2294, i will go along with you mr frodo  said sam (in spite of private misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the eastfarthing) ,LOTR1,False
2295, then if we are going to toil through bog and briar let go now ,LOTR1,False
2296, it wa already nearly a hot a it had been the day before; but cloud were beginning to come up from the west ,LOTR1,False
2297, it looked likely to turn to rain ,LOTR1,False
2298, the hobbit scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick tree below ,LOTR1,False
2299, their course had been chosen to leave woodhall to their left and to cut slanting through the wood that clustered along the eastern side of the hill until they reached the flat beyond ,LOTR1,False
2300, then they could make straight for the ferry over country that wa open except for a few ditche and fence ,LOTR1,False
2301, frodo reckoned they had eighteen mile to go in a straight line ,LOTR1,False
2302, he soon found that the thicket wa closer and more tangled than it had appeared ,LOTR1,False
2303, there were no path in the undergrowth and they did not get on very fast ,LOTR1,False
2304, when they had struggled to the bottom of the bank they found a stream running down from the hill behind in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery side overhung with bramble ,LOTR1,False
2305, most inconveniently it cut acros the line they had chosen ,LOTR1,False
2306, they could not jump over it nor indeed get acros it at all without getting wet scratched and muddy ,LOTR1,False
2307, they halted wondering what to do ,LOTR1,False
2308, through an opening in the tree he caught a glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down ,LOTR1,False
2309, he said clutching frodo by the arm ,LOTR1,False
2310, they all looked and on the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing ,LOTR1,False
2311, beside it stooped a black figure ,LOTR1,False
2312, they at once gave up any idea of going back ,LOTR1,False
2313, frodo led the way and plunged quickly into the thick bushe beside the stream ,LOTR1,False
2314, the short cut ha gone crooked already; but we got under cover only just in time ,LOTR1,False
2315, youve got sharp ear sam: can you hear anything coming ,LOTR1,False
2316, they stood still almost holding their breath a they listened; but there wa no sound of pursuit ,LOTR1,False
2317, i dont fancy he would try bringing hi horse down that bank  said sam ,LOTR1,False
2318, but i gu he know we came down it ,LOTR1,False
2319, we had better be going on ,LOTR1,False
2320, going on wa not altogether easy ,LOTR1,False
2321, they had pack to carry and the bushe and bramble were reluctant to let them through ,LOTR1,False
2322, they were cut off from the wind by the ridge behind and the air wa still and stuffy ,LOTR1,False
2323, when they forced their way at last into more open ground they were hot and tired and very scratched and they were also no longer certain of the direction in which they were going ,LOTR1,False
2324, the bank of the stream sank a it reached the level and became broader and shallower wandering off toward the marish and the river ,LOTR1,False
2325, why thi i the stock brook ,LOTR1,False
2326, if we are going to try and get back on to our course we must cros at once and bear right ,LOTR1,False
2327, they waded the stream and hurried over a wide open space rush grown and treel on the further side ,LOTR1,False
2328, beyond that they came again to a belt of trees: tall oak for the most part with here and there an elm tree or an ash ,LOTR1,False
2329, the ground wa fairly level and there wa little undergrowth; but the tree were loo close for them to see far ahead ,LOTR1,False
2330, the leave blew upward in sudden gust of wind and spot of rain began to fall from the overcast sky ,LOTR1,False
2331, then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down ,LOTR1,False
2332, they trudged along a fast a they could over patche of gras and through thick drift of old leaves; and all about them the rain pattered and trickled ,LOTR1,False
2333, they did not talk but kept glancing back and from side to side ,LOTR1,False
2334, after half an hour pippin said: i hope we have not turned too much toward the south and are not walking longwise through thi wood ,LOTR1,False
2335, it i not a very broad belt i should have said no more than a mile at the widest and we ought to have been through it by now ,LOTR1,False
2336, it i no good our starting to go in zig zag  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
2337, let u keep on a we are going ,LOTR1,False
2338, i am not sure that i want to come out into the open yet ,LOTR1,False
2339, they went on for perhap another couple of mile ,LOTR1,False
2340, then the sun gleamed out of ragged cloud again and the rain lessened ,LOTR1,False
2341, it wa now past mid day and they felt it wa high time for lunch ,LOTR1,False
2342, they halted under an elm tree: it leave though fast turning yellow were still thick and the ground at it feel wa fairly dry and sheltered ,LOTR1,False
2343, when they came to make their meal they found that the elve had filled their bottle with a clear drink pale golden in colour: it had the scent of a honey made of many flower and wa wonderfully refreshing ,LOTR1,False
2344, very soon they were laughing and snapping their finger at rain and at black rider ,LOTR1,False
2345, the last few mile they felt would soon be behind them ,LOTR1,False
2346, frodo propped hi back against the tree trunk and closed hi eye ,LOTR1,False
2347, sam and pippin sat near and they began to hum and then to sing softly: ho ,LOTR1,False
2348, to the bottle i go to heal my heart and drown my woe ,LOTR1,False
2349, rain may fall and wind may blow and many mile be still to go but under a tall tree i will lie and let the cloud go sailing by ,LOTR1,False
2350, frodo sprang to hi feet ,LOTR1,False
2351, a long drawn wail came down the wind like the cry of some evil and lonely creature ,LOTR1,False
2352, it rose and fell and ended on a high piercing note ,LOTR1,False
2353, even a they sat and stood a if suddenly frozen it wa answered by another cry fainter and further off but no l chilling to the blood ,LOTR1,False
2354, there wa then a silence broken only by the sound of the wind in the leave ,LOTR1,False
2355, and what do you think that was ,LOTR1,False
2356, pippin asked at last trying to speak lightly but quavering a little ,LOTR1,False
2357, if it wa a bird it wa one that i never heard in the shire before ,LOTR1,False
2358, it wa not bird or beast  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
2359, it wa a call or a signal there were word in that cry though i could not catch them ,LOTR1,False
2360, but no hobbit ha such a voice ,LOTR1,False
2361, no more wa said about it ,LOTR1,False
2362, they were all thinking of the rider but no one spoke of them ,LOTR1,False
2363, they were now reluctant either to stay or go on; but sooner or later they had got to get acros the open country to the ferry and it wa best to go sooner and in daylight ,LOTR1,False
2364, in a few moment they had shouldered their pack again and were off ,LOTR1,False
2365, before long the wood came to a sudden end ,LOTR1,False
2366, wide grass land stretched before them ,LOTR1,False
2367, they now saw that they had in fact turned too much to the south ,LOTR1,False
2368, away over the flat they could glimpse the low hill of bucklebury acros the river but it wa now to their left ,LOTR1,False
2369, creeping cautiously out from the edge of the tree they set off acros the open a quickly a they could ,LOTR1,False
2370, at first they felt afraid away from the shelter of the wood ,LOTR1,False
2371, far back behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted ,LOTR1,False
2372, frodo half expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky; but there wa no sign of one ,LOTR1,False
2373, the sun escaping from the breaking cloud a it sank toward the hill they had left wa now shining brightly again ,LOTR1,False
2374, their fear left them though they still felt uneasy ,LOTR1,False
2375, but the land became steadily more tame and well ordered ,LOTR1,False
2376, soon they came into well tended field and meadows: there were hedge and gate and dike for drainage ,LOTR1,False
2377, everything seemed quiet and peaceful just an ordinary corner of the shire ,LOTR1,False
2378, their spirit rose with every step ,LOTR1,False
2379, the line of the river grew nearer; and the black rider began to seem like phantom of the wood now left far behind ,LOTR1,False
2380, they passed along the edge of a huge turnip field and came to a stout gate ,LOTR1,False
2381, beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well laid hedge toward a distant clump of tree ,LOTR1,False
2382, i know these field and thi gate ,LOTR1,False
2383, thi i bamfurlong old farmer maggot land ,LOTR1,False
2384, that hi farm away there in the tree ,LOTR1,False

2386, the other looked at him in surprise ,LOTR1,False
2387, what wrong with old maggot ,LOTR1,False

2391, but all the same  he added with a shamefaced laugh i am terrified of him and hi dog ,LOTR1,False
2392, i have avoided hi farm for year and year ,LOTR1,False
2393, he caught me several time trespassing after mushroom when i wa a youngster at brandy hall ,LOTR1,False
2394, on the last occasion he beat me and then took me and showed me to hi dog ,LOTR1,False
2395, see lad he said next time thi young varmint set foot on my land you can eat him ,LOTR1,False
2396, they chased me all the way to the ferry ,LOTR1,False
2397, i have never got over the fright though i daresay the beast knew their busin and would not really have touched me ,LOTR1,False
2398, well it time you made it up ,LOTR1,False
2399, especially if you are coming back to live in buckland ,LOTR1,False
2400, old maggot i really a stout fellow if you leave hi mushroom alone ,LOTR1,False
2401, fet get into the lane and then we shant be trespassing ,LOTR1,False
2402, if we meet him ill do the talking ,LOTR1,False
2403, he i a friend of merry and i used to come here with him a good deal at one time ,LOTR1,False
2404, they went along the lane until they saw the thatched roof of a large house and farm building peeping out among the tree ahead ,LOTR1,False
2405, the maggot and the puddifoot of stock and most of the inhabitant of the marish were house dwellers; and thi farm wa stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all round it ,LOTR1,False
2406, there wa a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane ,LOTR1,False
2407, suddenly a they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out and a loud voice wa heard shouting: grip ,LOTR1,False
2408, frodo and sam stopped dead but pippin walked on a few pace ,LOTR1,False
2409, the gate opened and three huge dog came pelting out into the lane and dashed toward the traveller barking fiercely ,LOTR1,False
2410, they took no notice of pippin; but sam shrank against the wall while two wolvish looking dog sniffed at him suspiciously and snarled if he moved ,LOTR1,False
2411, the largest and most ferociou of the three halted in front of frodo bristling and growling ,LOTR1,False
2412, through the gate there now appeared a broad thick set hobbit with a round red face ,LOTR1,False
2413, and who may you be and what may you be wanting ,LOTR1,False
2414, the farmer looked at him closely ,LOTR1,False
2415, well if it isnt master pippin mr peregrin took i should say ,LOTR1,False
2416, he cried changing from a scowl to a grin ,LOTR1,False

2423, but thi fellow wa the most outlandish i have ever set eye on ,LOTR1,False
2424, he wont cros my land without leave a second time not if i can stop it ,LOTR1,False
2425, what fellow do you mean ,LOTR1,False
2426, then you havent seen him ,LOTR1,False
2427, he went up the lane toward the causeway not a long while back ,LOTR1,False
2428, he wa a funny customer and asking funny question ,LOTR1,False

2430, ive a drop of good ale on tap if you and your friend are willing mr took ,LOTR1,False

2432, they wont harm you not unl i tell em to ,LOTR1,False
2433, to the relief of frodo and sam the dog walked away and let them go free ,LOTR1,False
2434, pippin introduced the other two to the farmer ,LOTR1,False
2435, mr frodo baggin  he said ,LOTR1,False
2436, you may not remember him but he used to live at brandy hall ,LOTR1,False
2437, at the name baggin the farmer started and gave frodo a sharp glance ,LOTR1,False
2438, for a moment frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushroom had been aroused and that the dog would be told to see him off ,LOTR1,False
2439, but farmer maggot took him by the arm ,LOTR1,False
2440, well if that isnt queerer than ever ,LOTR1,False
2441, we must have a talk ,LOTR1,False
2442, they went into the farmer kitchen and sat by the wide fire place ,LOTR1,False
2443, maggot brought out beer in a huge jug and filled four large mug ,LOTR1,False
2444, it wa a good brew and pippin found himself more than compensated for missing the golden perch ,LOTR1,False
2445, sam sipped hi beer suspiciously ,LOTR1,False
2446, he had a natural mistrust of the inhabitant of other part of the shire; and also he wa not disposed to be quick friend with anyone who had beaten hi master however long ago ,LOTR1,False
2447, after a few remark about the weather and the agricultural prospect (which were no worse than usual) farmer maggot put down hi mug and looked at them all in turn ,LOTR1,False
2448, now mr peregrin  he said where might you be coming from and where might you be going to ,LOTR1,False
2449, were you coming to visit me ,LOTR1,False
2450, for if so you had gone past my gate without my seeing you ,LOTR1,False
2451, well no  answered pippin ,LOTR1,False
2452, to tell you the truth since you have guessed it we got into the lane from the other end: we had come over your field ,LOTR1,False
2453, but that wa quite by accident ,LOTR1,False
2454, we lost our way in the wood back near woodhall trying to take a short cut to the ferry ,LOTR1,False
2455, if you were in a hurry the road would have served you better  said the farmer ,LOTR1,False
2456, but i wasnt worrying about that ,LOTR1,False
2457, you have leave to walk over my land if you have a mind mr peregrin ,LOTR1,False
2458, and you mr baggin though i daresay you still like mushrooms he laughed ,LOTR1,False
2459, ah ye i recognized the name ,LOTR1,False

2461, but it wasnt mushroom i wa thinking of ,LOTR1,False
2462, i had just heard the name baggin before you turned up ,LOTR1,False
2463, what do you think that funny customer asked me ,LOTR1,False
2464, they waited anxiously for him to go on ,LOTR1,False
2465, well  the farmer continued approaching hi point with slow relish he came riding on a big black horse in at the gate which happened to be open and right up to my door ,LOTR1,False
2466, all black he wa himself too and cloaked and hooded up a if he did not want to be known ,LOTR1,False
2467, now what in the shire can he want ,LOTR1,False
2468, we dont see many of the big folk over the border; and anyway i had never heard of any like thi black fellow ,LOTR1,False
2469,  good day to you ,LOTR1,False

2471, thi lane dont lead anywhere and wherever you may be going your quickest way will be back to the road ,LOTR1,False
2472, i didnt like the look of him; and when grip came out he took one sniff and let out a yelp a if he had been slung: he put down hi tail and bolted off howling ,LOTR1,False
2473, the black fellow sat quite still ,LOTR1,False
2474,  i come from yonder he said slow and stiff like pointing back west over my field if you please ,LOTR1,False
2475, he asked in a queer voice and bent down toward me ,LOTR1,False
2476, i could not see any face for hi hood fell down so low; and i felt a sort of shiver down my back ,LOTR1,False
2477, but i did not see why he should come riding over my land so bold ,LOTR1,False
2478, there are no bagginse here ,LOTR1,False
2479, youre in the wrong part of the shire ,LOTR1,False
2480, you had better go back west to hobbiton but you can go by road thi time ,LOTR1,False
2481,  baggin ha left he answered in a whisper ,LOTR1,False
2482, he i not far away ,LOTR1,False

2489, he gave a sort of his ,LOTR1,False
2490, it might have been laughing and it might not ,LOTR1,False
2491, then he spurred hi great horse right at me and i jumped out of the way only just in time ,LOTR1,False
2492, i called the dog but he swung off and rode through the gate and up the lane toward the causeway like a bolt of thunder ,LOTR1,False
2493, what do you think of that ,LOTR1,False
2494, frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire but hi only thought wa how on earth would they reach the ferry ,LOTR1,False
2495, i dont know what to think  he said at last ,LOTR1,False
2496, then ill tell you what to think  said maggot ,LOTR1,False
2497, you should never have gone mixing yourself up with hobbiton folk mr frodo ,LOTR1,False
2498, folk are queer up there ,LOTR1,False
2499, sam stirred in hi chair and looked at the farmer with an unfriendly eye ,LOTR1,False
2500, but you were alway a reckl lad ,LOTR1,False
2501, when i heard you had left the brandybuck and gone off to that old mr bilbo i said that you were going to find trouble ,LOTR1,False

2504, maybe there i some that want to know what ha become of the gold and jewel that he buried in the hill of hobbiton a i hear ,LOTR1,False
2505, frodo said nothing: the shrewd guesse of the farmer were rather disconcerting ,LOTR1,False

2802, ye the ring  said merry ,LOTR1,False
2803, my dear old hobbit you dont allow for the inquisitiven of friend ,LOTR1,False
2804, i have known about the existence of the ring for year before bilbo went away in fact; but since he obviously regarded it a secret i kept the knowledge in my head until we formed our conspiracy ,LOTR1,False
2805, i did not know bilbo of course a well a i know you; i wa too young and he wa also more careful but he wa not careful enough ,LOTR1,False
2806, if you want to know how i first found out i will tell you ,LOTR1,False
2807, it wa the sackville bagginse that were hi downfall a you might expect ,LOTR1,False
2808, one day a year before the party i happened to be walking along the road when i saw bilbo ahead ,LOTR1,False
2809, suddenly in the distance the ,LOTR1,False
2810, bilbo slowed down and then hey presto ,LOTR1,False
2811, i wa so startled that i hardly had the wit to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion; but i got through the hedge and walked along the field inside ,LOTR1,False
2812, i wa peeping through into the road after the ,LOTR1,False
2813, had passed and wa looking straight at bilbo when he suddenly reappeared ,LOTR1,False
2814, i caught a glint of gold a he put something back in hi trouser pocket ,LOTR1,False
2815, after that i kept my eye open ,LOTR1,False
2816, in fact i conf that i spied ,LOTR1,False
2817, but you must admit that it wa very intriguing and i wa only in my teen ,LOTR1,False
2818, i must be the only one in the shire beside you frodo that ha ever seen the old fellow secret book ,LOTR1,False
2819, you have read hi book ,LOTR1,False
2820, not too safe i should say  said merry ,LOTR1,False
2821, but i have only had one rapid glance and that wa difficult to get ,LOTR1,False
2822, he never left the book about ,LOTR1,False
2823, i wonder what became of it ,LOTR1,False
2824, i should like another look ,LOTR1,False
2825, have you got it frodo ,LOTR1,False
2826, it wa not at bag end ,LOTR1,False
2827, he must have taken it away ,LOTR1,False
2828, well a i wa saying  merry proceeded i kept my knowledge to myself till thi spring when thing got seriou ,LOTR1,False
2829, then we formed our conspiracy; and a we were seriou too and meant busin we have not been too scrupulou ,LOTR1,False
2830, you are not a very easy nut to crack and gandalf i worse ,LOTR1,False
2831, but if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator i can produce him ,LOTR1,False
2832, said frodo looking round a if he expected a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard ,LOTR1,False
2833, said merry; and sam stood up with a face scarlet up to the ear ,LOTR1,False
2834, here our collector of information  ,LOTR1,False
2835, and he collected a lot i can tell you before he wa finally caught ,LOTR1,False
2836, after which i may say he seemed to regard himself a on parole and dried up ,LOTR1,False
2837, cried frodo feeling that amazement could go no further and quite unable to decide whether he felt angry amused relieved or merely foolish ,LOTR1,False
2838, but i meant no wrong to you mr frodo nor to mr gandalf for that matter ,LOTR1,False
2839, he ha some sense mind you; and when you said go alone he said no ,LOTR1,False
2840, lake someone a you can trust ,LOTR1,False
2841,  but it doe not seem that i can trust anyone  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
2842, sam looked at him unhappily ,LOTR1,False
2843, it all depend on what you want  put in merry ,LOTR1,False
2844, you can trust u to stick to you through thick and thin to the bitter end ,LOTR1,False
2845, and you can trust u to keep any secret of your closer than you keep it yourself ,LOTR1,False
2846, but you cannot trust u to let you face trouble alone and go off without a word ,LOTR1,False
2847, we are your friend frodo ,LOTR1,False
2848, we know most of what gandalf ha told you ,LOTR1,False
2849, we know a good deal about the ring ,LOTR1,False
2850, we are horribly afraid but we are coming with you; or following you like hound ,LOTR1,False
2851, and after all sir  added sam you did ought to take the elves advice ,LOTR1,False
2852, gildor said you should take them a wa willing and you cant deny it ,LOTR1,False
2853, i dont deny it  said frodo looking at sam who wa now grinning ,LOTR1,False
2854, i dont deny it but ill never believe you are sleeping again whether you snore or not ,LOTR1,False
2855, i shall kick you hard to make sure ,LOTR1,False
2856, you are a set of deceitful scoundrels ,LOTR1,False
2857, he said turning to the other ,LOTR1,False
2858, he laughed getting up and waving hi arm i give in ,LOTR1,False
2859, i will take gildor advice ,LOTR1,False
2860, if the danger were not so dark i should dance for joy ,LOTR1,False
2861, even so i cannot help feeling happy; happier than i have felt for a long time ,LOTR1,False
2862, i had dreaded thi evening ,LOTR1,False
2863, three cheer for captain frodo and company ,LOTR1,False
2864, they shouted; and they danced round him ,LOTR1,False
2865, merry and pippin began a song which they had apparently got ready for the occasion ,LOTR1,False
2866, it wa made on the model of the dwarf song that started bilbo on hi adventure long ago and went to the same tune: farewell we call to hearth and hall ,LOTR1,False
2867, though wind may blow and rain may fall we must away ere break of day far over wood and mountain tall ,LOTR1,False
2868, to rivendell where elve yet dwell in glade beneath the misty fell through moor and waste we ride in haste and whither then we cannot tell ,LOTR1,False
2869, with foe ahead behind u dread beneath the sky shall be our bed until at last our toil be passed our journey done our errand sped ,LOTR1,False
2870, we ride before the break of day ,LOTR1,False
2871, but in that case there are a lot of thing to do before we go to bed under a roof for tonight at any rate ,LOTR1,False
2872, do you really mean to start before the break of day ,LOTR1,False
2873, i dont know  answered frodo ,LOTR1,False
2874, i fear those black rider and i am sure it i unsafe to stay in one place long especially in a place to which it i known i wa going ,LOTR1,False
2875, also gildor advised me not to wait ,LOTR1,False
2876, but i should very much like to see gandalf ,LOTR1,False
2877, i could see that even gildor wa disturbed when he heard that gandalf had never appeared ,LOTR1,False
2878, it really depend on two thing ,LOTR1,False
2879, flow soon could the rider get to bucklebury ,LOTR1,False
2880, and how soon could we get off ,LOTR1,False
2881, it will take a good deal of preparation ,LOTR1,False
2882, the answer to the second question  said merry i that we could get off in an hour ,LOTR1,False
2883, i have prepared practically everything ,LOTR1,False
2884, there are six ponie in a stable acros the fields; store and tackle are all packed except for a few extra clothe and the perishable food ,LOTR1,False
2885, it seem to have been a very efficient conspiracy  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
2886, but what about the black riders ,LOTR1,False
2887, would it be safe to wait one day for gandalf ,LOTR1,False
2888, that all depend on what you think the rider would do if they found you here  answered merry ,LOTR1,False
2889, they could have reached here by now of course if they were not stopped at the north gate where the hedge run down to the river bank just thi side of the bridge ,LOTR1,False
2890, the gate guard would not let them through by night though they might break through ,LOTR1,False
2891, even in the daylight they would try to keep them out i think at any rate until they got a message through to the master of the hall for they would not like the look of the rider and would certainly be frightened by them ,LOTR1,False
2892, but of course buckland cannot resist a determined attack for long ,LOTR1,False
2893, and it i possible that in the morning even a black rider that rode up and asked for mr baggin would be let through ,LOTR1,False
2894, it i pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at crickhollow ,LOTR1,False
2895, frodo sat for a while in thought ,LOTR1,False
2896, i have made up my mind  he said finally ,LOTR1,False
2897, i am starting tomorrow a soon a it i light ,LOTR1,False
2898, but i am not going by road: it would be safer to wait here than that ,LOTR1,False
2899, if i go through the north gate my departure from buckland will be known at once instead of being secret for several day at least a it might be ,LOTR1,False
2900, and what i more the bridge and the east road near the border will certainly be watched whether any rider get into buckland or not ,LOTR1,False
2901, we dont know how many there are; but there are at least two and possibly more ,LOTR1,False
2902, the only thing to do i to go off in a quite unexpected direction ,LOTR1,False
2903, but that can only mean going into the old forest ,LOTR1,False
2904, you cant be thinking of doing that ,LOTR1,False
2905, it i quite a dangerou a black rider ,LOTR1,False
2906, not quite  said merry ,LOTR1,False
2907, it sound very desperate but i believe frodo i right ,LOTR1,False
2908, it i the only way of getting off without being followed at once ,LOTR1,False
2909, with luck we might gel a considerable start ,LOTR1,False
2910, but you wont have any luck in the old forest  objected fredegar ,LOTR1,False
2911, no one ever ha luck in there ,LOTR1,False
2912, people dont go in there ,LOTR1,False
2913, the brandybuck go in occasionally when the fit take them ,LOTR1,False
2914, we have a private entrance ,LOTR1,False
2915, frodo went in once long ago ,LOTR1,False
2916, i have been in several times: usually in daylight of course when the tree are sleepy and fairly quiet ,LOTR1,False
2917, well do a you think best ,LOTR1,False
2918, i am more afraid of the old forest than of anything i know about: the storie about it are a nightmare; but my vote hardly count a i am not going on the journey ,LOTR1,False
2919, still i am very glad someone i stopping behind who can tell gandalf what you have done when he turn up a i am sure he will before long ,LOTR1,False
2920, fond a he wa of frodo fatty bolger had no desire to leave the shire nor to see what lay outside it ,LOTR1,False
2921, hi family came from the eastfarthing from budgeford in bridgefield in fact but he had never been over the brandywine bridge ,LOTR1,False
2922, hi task according to the original plan of the conspirator wa to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk and to keep up a long a possible the pretence that mr baggin wa still living at crickhollow ,LOTR1,False
2923, he had even brought along some old clothe of frodo to help him in playing the part ,LOTR1,False
2924, they little thought how dangerou that part might prove ,LOTR1,False
2925, said frodo when he understood the plan ,LOTR1,False
2926, we could not have left any message behind for gandalf otherwise ,LOTR1,False
2927, i dont know whether these rider can read or not of course but i should not have dared to risk a written message in case they got in and searched the house ,LOTR1,False
2928, but if fatty i willing to hold the fort and i can be sure of gandalf knowing the way we have gone that decide me ,LOTR1,False
2929, i am going into the old forest first thing tomorrow ,LOTR1,False
2930, well that that  said pippin ,LOTR1,False
2931, on the whole i would rather have our job than fatty waiting here till black rider come ,LOTR1,False
2932, you wait till you are well inside the forest  said fredegar ,LOTR1,False
2933, youll wish you were back here with me before thi time tomorrow ,LOTR1,False
2934, it no good arguing about it any more  said merry ,LOTR1,False
2935, we have still got to tidy up and put the finishing touche to the packing before we get to bed ,LOTR1,False
2936, i shall call you all before the break of day ,LOTR1,False
2937, when at last he had got to bed frodo could not sleep for some time ,LOTR1,False
2938, wa glad that he wa riding in the morning ,LOTR1,False
2939, eventually he fell into a vague dream in which he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark sea of tangled tree ,LOTR1,False
2940, down below among the root there wa the sound of creature crawling and snuffling ,LOTR1,False
2941, he felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later ,LOTR1,False
2942, then he heard a noise in the distance ,LOTR1,False
2943, at first he thought it wa a great wind coming over the leave of the forest ,LOTR1,False
2944, then he knew that it wa not leave but the sound of the sea far off; a sound he had never heard in waking life though it had often troubled hi dream suddenly he found he wa out in the open ,LOTR1,False
2945, there were no tree after all ,LOTR1,False
2946, he wa on a dark heath and there wa a strange salt smell in the air ,LOTR1,False
2947, looking up he saw before him a tall white tower standing alone on a high ridge ,LOTR1,False
2948, a great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the sea ,LOTR1,False
2949, he started to struggle up the ridge toward the tower: but suddenly a light came in the sky and there wa a noise of thunder ,LOTR1,False
2950, the old forest frodo woke suddenly ,LOTR1,False
2951, it wa still dark in the room ,LOTR1,False
2952, merry wa standing there with a candle in one hand and banging on the door with the other ,LOTR1,False
2953, said frodo still shaken and bewildered ,LOTR1,False
2954, it i time to get up ,LOTR1,False
2955, it i half past four and very foggy ,LOTR1,False
2956, sam i already getting breakfast ready ,LOTR1,False
2957, i am just going to saddle the ponie and fetch the one that i to be the baggage carrier ,LOTR1,False
2958, at least he must get up and see u off ,LOTR1,False
2959, soon after six oclock the five hobbit were ready to start ,LOTR1,False
2960, fatty bolger wa still yawning ,LOTR1,False
2961, they stole quietly out of the house ,LOTR1,False
2962, merry went in front leading a laden pony and took hi way along a path that went through a spinney behind the house and then cut acros several field ,LOTR1,False
2963, the leave of tree were glistening and every twig wa dripping; the gras wa grey with cold dew ,LOTR1,False
2964, everything wa still and far away noise seemed near and clear: fowl chattering in a yard someone closing a door of a distant house ,LOTR1,False
2965, in their shed they found the ponies; sturdy little beast of the kind loved by hobbit not speedy but good for a long day work ,LOTR1,False
2966, they mounted and soon they were riding off into the mist which seemed to open reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them ,LOTR1,False
2967, after riding for about an hour slowly and without talking they saw the fledge looming suddenly ahead ,LOTR1,False
2968, it wa tall and netted over with silver cobweb ,LOTR1,False
2969, how are you going to get through this ,LOTR1,False
2970, said merry and you will see ,LOTR1,False
2971, he turned to the left along the hedge and soon they came to a point where it bent inward running along the lip of a hollow ,LOTR1,False
2972, a cutting had been made at some distance from the hedge and went sloping gently down into the ground ,LOTR1,False
2973, it had wall of brick at the side which rose steadily until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep under the hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side ,LOTR1,False
2974, i wish you were not going into the forest ,LOTR1,False
2975, i only hope you will not need rescuing before the day i out ,LOTR1,False
2976, but good luck to you today and every day ,LOTR1,False
2977, if there are no worse thing ahead than the old forest i shall be lucky  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
2978, tell gandalf to hurry along the east road: we shall soon be back on it and going a fast a we can ,LOTR1,False
2979, they cried and rode down the slope and disappeared from fredegar sight into the tunnel ,LOTR1,False
2980, it wa dark and damp ,LOTR1,False
2981, at the far end it wa closed by a gate of thick set iron bar ,LOTR1,False
2982, merry got down and unlocked the gate and when they had all passed through he pushed it to again ,LOTR1,False
2983, it shut with a clang and the lock clicked ,LOTR1,False
2984, you have left the shire and are now outside and on the edge of the old forest ,LOTR1,False
2985, are the storie about it true ,LOTR1,False
2986, i dont know what storie you mean  merry answered ,LOTR1,False
2987, if you mean the old bogey storie fatty nurse used to tell him about goblin and wolve and thing of that sort i should say no ,LOTR1,False
2988, at any rate i dont believe them ,LOTR1,False
2989, but the forest i queer ,LOTR1,False
2990, everything in it i very much more alive more aware of what i going on so to speak than thing are in the shire ,LOTR1,False
2991, and the tree do not like stranger ,LOTR1,False
2992, they are usually content merely to watch you a long a daylight last and dont do much ,LOTR1,False
2993, occasionally the most unfriendly one may drop a branch or stick a root out or grasp at you with a long trailer ,LOTR1,False
2994, but at night thing can be most alarming or so i am told ,LOTR1,False
2995, i have only once or twice been in here after dark and then only near the hedge ,LOTR1,False
2996, i thought all the tree were whispering to each other passing new and plot along in an unintelligible language; and the branche swayed and groped without any wind ,LOTR1,False
2997, they do say the tree do actually move and can surround stranger and hem them in ,LOTR1,False
2998, in fact long ago they attacked the hedge: they came and planted themselve right by it and leaned over it ,LOTR1,False
2999, but the hobbit came and cut down hundred of tree and made a great bonfire in the forest and burned all the ground in a long strip east of the hedge ,LOTR1,False
3000, after that the tree gave up the attack but they became very unfriendly ,LOTR1,False
3001, there i still a wide bare space not far inside where the bonfire wa made ,LOTR1,False
3002, i it only the tree that are dangerous ,LOTR1,False
3003, there are variou queer thing living deep in the forest and on the far side  said merry or at least i have heard so; but i have never seen any of them ,LOTR1,False
3004, whenever one come inside one find open tracks; but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer fashion ,LOTR1,False
3005, not far from thi tunnel there i or wa for a long time the beginning of quite a broad path leading to the bonfire glade and then on more or l in our direction east and a little north ,LOTR1,False
3006, that i the path i am going to try and find ,LOTR1,False
3007, the hobbit now left the tunnel gate and rode acros the wide hollow ,LOTR1,False
3008, on the far side wa a faint path leading up on to the floor of the forest a hundred yard and more beyond the hedge; but it vanished a soon a it brought them under the tree ,LOTR1,False
3009, looking back they could see the dark line of the hedge through the stem of tree that were already thick about them ,LOTR1,False
3010, looking ahead they could see only tree trunk of innumerable size and shapes: straight or bent twisted leaning squat or slender smooth or gnarled and branched; and all the stem were green or grey with mos and slimy shaggy growth ,LOTR1,False
3011, merry alone seemed fairly cheerful ,LOTR1,False
3012, you had better lead on and find that path  frodo said to him ,LOTR1,False
3013, dont let u lose one another or forget which way the hedge lies ,LOTR1,False
3014, they picked a way among the tree and their ponie plodded along carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing root ,LOTR1,False
3015, the ground wa rising steadily and a they went forward it seemed that the tree became taller darker and thicker ,LOTR1,False
3016, there wa no sound except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still leave ,LOTR1,False
3017, for the moment there wa no whispering or movement among the branches; but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being watched with disapproval deepening to dislike and even enmity ,LOTR1,False
3018, the feeling steadily grew until they found themselve looking up quickly or glancing back over their shoulder a if they expected a sudden blow ,LOTR1,False
3019, there wa not a yet any sign of a path and the tree seemed constantly to bar their way ,LOTR1,False
3020, pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it any longer and without warning let out a shout ,LOTR1,False
3021, i am not going to do anything ,LOTR1,False
3022, just let me pas through will you ,LOTR1,False
3023, the other halted startled; but the cry fell a if muffled by a heavy curtain ,LOTR1,False
3024, there wa no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become more crowded and more watchful than before ,LOTR1,False
3025, i should not shout if i were you  said merry ,LOTR1,False
3026, it doe more harm than good ,LOTR1,False
3027, frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through and if he had been right to make the other come into thi abominable wood ,LOTR1,False
3028, merry wa looking from side to side and seemed already uncertain which way to go ,LOTR1,False
3029, it ha not taken you long to lose u  he said ,LOTR1,False
3030, but at that moment merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead ,LOTR1,False
3031, there i the bonfire glade in front of u (or i hope so) but the path to it seem to have moved away ,LOTR1,False
3032, the light grew clearer a they went forward ,LOTR1,False
3033, suddenly they came out of the tree and found themselve in a wide circular space ,LOTR1,False
3034, there wa sky above them blue and clear to their surprise for down under the forest roof they had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist ,LOTR1,False
3035, the sun wa not however high enough yet to shine down into the clearing though it light wa on the tree top ,LOTR1,False
3036, the leave were all thicker and greener about the edge of the glade enclosing it with an almost solid wall ,LOTR1,False
3037, no tree grew there only rough gras and many tall plants: stalky and faded hemlock and wood parsley fire weed seeding into fluffy ashe and rampant nettle and thistle ,LOTR1,False
3038, a dreary place: but it seemed a charming and cheerful garden after the close forest ,LOTR1,False
3039, the hobbit felt encouraged and looked up hopefully at the broadening daylight in the sky ,LOTR1,False
3040, at the far side of the glade there wa a break in the wall of tree and a clear path beyond it ,LOTR1,False
3041, they could see it running on into the wood wide in place and open above though every now and again the tree drew in and overshadowed it with their dark bough ,LOTR1,False
3042, up thi path they rode ,LOTR1,False
3043, they were still climbing gently but they now went much quicker and with better heart; for it seemed to them that the forest had relented and wa going to let them pas unhindered after all ,LOTR1,False
3044, but after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy ,LOTR1,False
3045, the tree drew close again on either side and they could no longer see far ahead ,LOTR1,False
3046, now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on them ,LOTR1,False
3047, so silent wa it that the fall of their ponies hoof rustling on dead leave and occasionally stumbling on hidden root seemed to thud in their ear ,LOTR1,False
3048, frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them but hi voice sank to a murmur ,LOTR1,False
3049, wanderer in the shadowed land despair not ,LOTR1,False
3050, for though dark they stand all wood there be must end at last and see the open sun go past: the setting sun the rising sun the day end or the day begun ,LOTR1,False
3051, for east or west all wood must fail ,LOTR1,False
3052, fail even a he said the word hi voice faded into silence ,LOTR1,False
3053, the air seemed heavy and the making of word wearisome ,LOTR1,False
3054, just behind them a large branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash into the path ,LOTR1,False
3055, the tree seemed to close in before them ,LOTR1,False
3056, they do not like all that about ending and failing  said merry ,LOTR1,False
3057, i should not sing any more at present ,LOTR1,False
3058, wait till we do get to the edge and then well turn and give them a rousing chorus ,LOTR1,False
3059, he spoke cheerfully and if he felt any great anxiety he did not show it ,LOTR1,False
3060, the other did not answer ,LOTR1,False
3061, a heavy weight wa settling steadily on frodo heart and he regretted now with every step forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the tree ,LOTR1,False
3062, he wa indeed just about to stop and propose going back (if that wa still possible) when thing took a new turn ,LOTR1,False
3063, the path stopped climbing and became for a while nearly level ,LOTR1,False
3064, the dark tree drew aside and ahead they could see the path going almost straight forward ,LOTR1,False
3065, before them but some distance off there stood a green hill top treel rising like a bald head out of the encircling wood ,LOTR1,False
3066, the path seemed to be making directly for it ,LOTR1,False
3067, they now hurried forward again delighted with the thought of climbing out for a while above the roof of the forest ,LOTR1,False
3068, the path dipped and then again began to climb upward leading them at last to the foot of the steep hillside ,LOTR1,False
3069, there it left the tree and faded into the turf ,LOTR1,False
3070, the wood stood all round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown ,LOTR1,False
3071, the hobbit led their ponie up winding round and round until they reached the top ,LOTR1,False
3072, there they stood and gazed about them ,LOTR1,False
3073, the air wa gleaming and sunlit but hazy; and they could not see to any great distance ,LOTR1,False
3074, near at hand the mist wa now almost gone; though here and there it lay in hollow of the wood and to the south of them out of a deep fold cutting right acros the forest the fog still rose like steam or wisp of white smoke ,LOTR1,False
3075, that  said merry pointing with hi hand that i the line of the withywindle ,LOTR1,False
3076, it come down out of the down and flow south west through the midst of the forest to join the brandywine below haysend ,LOTR1,False
3077, we dont want to go that way ,LOTR1,False
3078, the withywindle valley i said to be the queerest part of the whole wood the centre from which all the queern come a it were ,LOTR1,False
3079, the other looked in the direction that merry pointed out but they could see little but mist over the damp and deep cut valley; and beyond it the southern half of the forest faded from view ,LOTR1,False
3080, the sun on the hill lop wa now getting hot ,LOTR1,False
3081, it must have been about eleven oclock; but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in other direction ,LOTR1,False
3082, in the west they could not make out either the line of the hedge or the valley of the brandywine beyond it ,LOTR1,False
3083, northward where they looked most hopefully they could see nothing that might be the line of the great east road for which they were making ,LOTR1,False
3084, they were on an island in a sea of tree and the horizon wa veiled ,LOTR1,False
3085, on the south eastern side the ground fell very steeply a if the slope of the hill were continued far down under the tree like island shore that really are the side of a mountain rising out of deep water ,LOTR1,False
3086, they sat on the green edge and looked out over the wood below them while they ate their mid day meal ,LOTR1,False
3087, a the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far off in the east the grey green line of the down that lay beyond the old forest on that side ,LOTR1,False
3088, that cheered them greatly; for it wa good to see a sight of anything beyond the wood border though they did not mean to go that way if they could help it: the barrow down had a sinister a reputation in hobbit legend a the forest itself ,LOTR1,False
3089, at length they made up their mind to go on again ,LOTR1,False
3090, the path that had brought them to the hill reappeared on the northward side; but they had not followed it far before they became aware that it wa bending steadily to the right ,LOTR1,False
3091, soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must actually be heading toward the withy windle valley: not at all the direction they wished lo take ,LOTR1,False
3092, after some discussion they decided to leave thi misleading path and strike northward; for although they had not been able to see it from the hill top the road must lie that way and it could not be many mile off ,LOTR1,False
3093, also northward and to the left of the path the land seemed lo be drier and more open climbing up to slope where the tree were thinner and pine and fir replaced the oak and ashe and other strange and namel tree of the denser wood ,LOTR1,False
3094, at first their choice seemed to be good: they got along at a fair speed though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemed unaccountably to have veered eastward ,LOTR1,False
3095, but after a time the tree began to close in again just where they had appeared from a distance to be thinner and l tangled ,LOTR1,False
3096, then deep fold in the ground were discovered unexpectedly like the rut of great giant wheel or wide moat and sunken road long disused and choked with bramble ,LOTR1,False
3097, these lay usually right acros their line of march and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out again which wa troublesome and difficult with their ponie ,LOTR1,False
3098, each time they climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushe and matted undergrowth which somehow would not yield to the left but only gave way when they turned to the right; and they had to go some distance along the bottom before they could find a way up the further bank ,LOTR1,False
3099, each time they clambered out the tree seemed deeper and darker; and alway to the left and upward it wa most difficult to find a way and they were forced to the right and downward ,LOTR1,False
3100, after an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction though they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all ,LOTR1,False
3101, they were being headed off and were simply following a course chosen for them eastward and southward into the heart of the forest and not out of it ,LOTR1,False
3102, the afternoon wa wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled into a fold that wa wider and deeper than any they had yet met ,LOTR1,False
3103, it wa so sleep and overhung that it proved impossible to climb out of it again either forward or backward without leaving their ponie and their baggage behind ,LOTR1,False
3104, all they could do wa to follow the fold downward ,LOTR1,False
3105, the ground grew soft and in place boggy; spring appeared in the bank and soon they found themselve following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed ,LOTR1,False
3106, then the ground began to fall rapidly and the brook growing strong and noisy flowed and leaped swiftly downhill ,LOTR1,False
3107, they were in a deep dim lit gully over arched by tree high above them ,LOTR1,False
3108, after stumbling along for some way along the stream they came quite suddenly out of the gloom ,LOTR1,False
3109, a if through a gate they saw the sunlight before them ,LOTR1,False
3110, coming to the opening they found that they had made their way down through a cleft in a high sleep bank almost a cliff ,LOTR1,False
3111, at it feet wa a wide space of gras and reeds; and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank almost a steep ,LOTR1,False
3112, a golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden land between ,LOTR1,False
3113, in the midst of it there wound lazily a dark river of brown water bordered with ancient willow arched over with willow blocked with fallen willow and flecked with thousand of faded willow leave ,LOTR1,False
3114, the air wa thick with them fluttering yellow from the branches; for there wa a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the valley and the reed were rustling and the willow bough were creaking ,LOTR1,False
3115, well now i have at least some notion of where we are ,LOTR1,False
3116, we have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended ,LOTR1,False
3117, thi i the river withy windle ,LOTR1,False
3118, i will go on and explore ,LOTR1,False
3119, he passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasse ,LOTR1,False
3120, after a while he reappeared and reported that there wa fairly solid ground between the cliff foot and the river; in some place firm turf went down to the water edge ,LOTR1,False
3121, what more  he said there seem to be something like a footpath winding along on thi side of the river ,LOTR1,False
3122, if we turn left and follow it we shall be bound to come out on the east side of the forest eventually ,LOTR1,False
3123, that i if the track goe on so far and doe not simply lead u into a bog and leave u there ,LOTR1,False
3124, who made the track do you suppose and why ,LOTR1,False
3125, i am sure it wa not for our benefit ,LOTR1,False
3126, i am getting very suspiciou of thi forest and everything in it and i begin to believe all the storie about it ,LOTR1,False
3127, and have you any idea how far eastward we should have to go ,LOTR1,False
3128, no  said merry i havent ,LOTR1,False
3129, i dont know in the least how far down the withywindle we are or who could possibly come here often enough to make a path along it ,LOTR1,False
3130, but there i no other way out that i can see or think of ,LOTR1,False
3131, there being nothing else for it they filed out and merry led them to the path that he had discovered ,LOTR1,False
3132, everywhere the reed and grasse were lush and tall in place far above their heads; but once found the path wa easy to follow a it turned and twisted picking out the sounder ground among the bog and pool ,LOTR1,False
3133, here and there it passed over other rill running down gullie into the withywindle out of the higher forest land and at these point there were tree trunk or bundle of brushwood laid carefully acros ,LOTR1,False
3134, the hobbit began to feel very hot ,LOTR1,False
3135, there were armie of flie of all kind buzzing round their ear and the afternoon sun wa burning on their back ,LOTR1,False
3136, at last they came suddenly into a thin shade; great grey branche reached acros the path ,LOTR1,False
3137, each step forward became more reluctant than the last ,LOTR1,False
3138, sleepin seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their leg and falling softly out of the air upon their head and eye ,LOTR1,False
3139, frodo felt hi chin go down and hi head nod ,LOTR1,False
3140, just in front of him pippin fell forward on to hi knee ,LOTR1,False
3141, it no good  he heard merry saying ,LOTR1,False
3142, cant go another step without rest ,LOTR1,False
3143, it cool under the willow ,LOTR1,False
3144, frodo did not like the sound of thi ,LOTR1,False
3145, we cant have a nap yet ,LOTR1,False
3146, we must get clear of the forest first ,LOTR1,False
3147, but the other were too far gone to care ,LOTR1,False
3148, beside them sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly ,LOTR1,False
3149, suddenly frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him ,LOTR1,False
3150, there now seemed hardly a sound in the air ,LOTR1,False
3151, the flie had stopped buzzing ,LOTR1,False
3152, only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing a soft fluttering a of a song half whispered seemed to stir in the bough above ,LOTR1,False
3153, he lifted hi heavy eye and saw leaning over him a huge willow tree old and hoary ,LOTR1,False
3154, enormou it looked it sprawling branche going up like reaching arm with many long fingered hand it knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissure that creaked faintly a the bough moved ,LOTR1,False
3155, the leave fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him and he toppled over lying where he fell upon the gras ,LOTR1,False
3156, merry and pippin dragged themselve forward and lay down with their back to the willow trunk ,LOTR1,False
3157, behind them the great crack gaped wide to receive them a the tree swayed and creaked ,LOTR1,False
3158, they looked up at the grey and yellow leave moving softly against the light and singing ,LOTR1,False
3159, they shut their eye and then it seemed that they could almost hear word cool word saying something about water and sleep ,LOTR1,False
3160, they gave themselve up to the spell and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow ,LOTR1,False
3161, frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that wa overpowering him; then with an effort he struggled to hi feel again ,LOTR1,False
3162, he felt a compelling desire for cool water ,LOTR1,False
3163, wait for me sam  he stammered ,LOTR1,False
3164, must bathe feet a minute ,LOTR1,False
3165, half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of the tree where great winding root grew out into the stream like gnarled dragonet straining down to drink ,LOTR1,False
3166, he straddled one of these and paddled hi hot feel in the cool brown water; and there he too suddenly fell asleep with hi back against the tree ,LOTR1,False
3167, sam sat down and scratched hi head and yawned like a cavern ,LOTR1,False
3168, the afternoon wa getting late and he thought thi sudden sleepin uncanny ,LOTR1,False
3169, there more behind thi than sun and warm air  he muttered to himself ,LOTR1,False
3170, i dont like thi great big tree ,LOTR1,False
3171, hark at it singing about sleep now ,LOTR1,False
3172, thi wont do at all ,LOTR1,False
3173, he pulled himself to hi feet and staggered off to see what had become of the ponie ,LOTR1,False
3174, he found that two had wandered on a good way along the path; and he had just caught them and brought them back toward the other when he heard two noises; one loud and the other soft but very clear ,LOTR1,False
3175, one wa the splash of something heavy falling into the water; the other wa a noise like the snick of a lock when a door quietly close fast ,LOTR1,False
3176, he rushed back to the bank ,LOTR1,False
3177, frodo wa in the water close to the edge and a great tree root seemed to be over him and holding him down but he wa not struggling ,LOTR1,False
3178, sam gripped him by the jacket and dragged him from under the root; and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank ,LOTR1,False
3179, almost at once he woke and coughed and spluttered ,LOTR1,False
3180, do you know sam  he said at length the beastly tree threw me in ,LOTR1,False
3181, the big root just twisted round and tipped me in ,LOTR1,False
3182, you were dreaming i expect mr frodo  said sam ,LOTR1,False
3183, you shouldnt sit in such a place if you feel sleepy ,LOTR1,False
3184, i wonder what sort of dream they are having ,LOTR1,False
3185, they went round to the other side of the tree and then sam understood the click that he had heard ,LOTR1,False
3186, the crack by which he had laid himself had closed together so that not a chink could be seen ,LOTR1,False
3187, merry wa trapped: another crack had closed about hi waist; hi leg lay outside but the rest of him wa inside a dark opening the edge of which gripped like a pair of pincer ,LOTR1,False
3188, frodo and sam beat first upon the tree trunk where pippin had lain ,LOTR1,False
3189, they then struggled frantically to pull open the jaw of the crack that held poor merry ,LOTR1,False
3190, what a foul thing to happen ,LOTR1,False
3191, why did we ever come into thi dreadful forest ,LOTR1,False
3192, i wish we were all back at crickhollow ,LOTR1,False
3193, he kicked the tree with all hi strength heedl of hi own feet ,LOTR1,False
3194, a hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches; the leave rustled and whispered but with a sound now of faint and far off laughter ,LOTR1,False
3195, i suppose we havent got an axe among our luggage mr frodo ,LOTR1,False
3196, i brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
3197, that wouldnt be much use ,LOTR1,False
3198, cried sam struck by an idea suggested by firewood ,LOTR1,False
3199, we might do something with fire ,LOTR1,False
3200, we might  said frodo doubtfully ,LOTR1,False
3201, we might succeed in roasting pippin alive inside ,LOTR1,False
3202, we might try to hurt or frighten thi tree to begin with  said sam fiercely ,LOTR1,False
3203, if it dont let them go ill have it down if i have to gnaw it ,LOTR1,False
3204, he ran to the ponie and before long came back with two tinder boxe and a hatchet ,LOTR1,False
3205, quickly they gathered dry gras and leave and bit of bark; and made a pile of broken twig and chopped stick ,LOTR1,False
3206, these they heaped against the trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoner ,LOTR1,False
3207, a soon a sam had struck a spark into the tinder it kindled the dry gras and a flurry of flame and smoke went up ,LOTR1,False
3208, little finger of fire licked against the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and scorched it ,LOTR1,False
3209, a tremor ran through the whole willow ,LOTR1,False
3210, the leave seemed to his above their head with a sound of pain and anger ,LOTR1,False
3211, a loud scream came from merry and from far inside the tree they heard pippin give a muffled yell ,LOTR1,False
3212, hell squeeze me in two if you dont ,LOTR1,False
3213, shouted frodo rushing round to the other side of the tree ,LOTR1,False
3214, the branche of the willow began to sway violently ,LOTR1,False
3215, there wa a sound a of a wind rising and spreading outward to the branche of all the other tree round about a though they had dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of the river valley and set up ripple of anger that ran out over the whole forest ,LOTR1,False
3216, sam kicked at the little fire and stamped out the spark ,LOTR1,False
3217, but frodo without any clear idea of why he did so or what he hoped for ran along the path crying help ,LOTR1,False
3218, it seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of hi own shrill voice: it wa blown away from him by the willow wind and drowned in a clamour of leave a soon a the word left hi mouth ,LOTR1,False
3219, he felt desperate: lost and witl ,LOTR1,False
3220, there wa an answer or so he thought; but it seemed to come from behind him away down the path further back in the forest ,LOTR1,False
3221, he turned round and listened and soon there could be no doubt: someone wa singing a song; a deep glad voice wa singing carelessly and happily but it wa singing nonsense: hey dol ,LOTR1,False
3222, tom bom jolly tom tom bombadillo ,LOTR1,False
3223, half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger frodo and sam now both stood still ,LOTR1,False
3224, suddenly out of a long string of nonsense word (or so they seemed) the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into thi song: hey ,LOTR1,False
3225, light goe the weather wind and the feathered starling ,LOTR1,False
3226, down along under hill shining in the sunlight waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight there my pretty lady i ,LOTR1,False
3227, river woman daughter slender a the willow wand clearer than the water ,LOTR1,False
3228, old tom bombadil water lilie bringing come hopping home again ,LOTR1,False
3229, can you hear him singing ,LOTR1,False
3230, and merry o goldberry goldberry merry yellow berry o ,LOTR1,False
3231, poor old willow man you tuck your root away ,LOTR1,False
3232, tom in a hurry now ,LOTR1,False
3233, tom going home again water lilie bringing ,LOTR1,False
3234, can you hear me singing ,LOTR1,False
3235, frodo and sam stood a if enchanted ,LOTR1,False
3236, the leave hung silently again on stiff branche ,LOTR1,False
3237, there wa another burst of song and then suddenly hopping and dancing along the path there appeared above the reed an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in the band ,LOTR1,False
3238, with another hop and a bound there came into view a man or so it seemed ,LOTR1,False
3239, at any rate he wa too large and heavy for a hobbit if not quite tall enough for one of the big people though he made noise enough for one slumping along with great yellow boot on hi thick leg and charging through gras and rushe like a cow going down to drink ,LOTR1,False
3240, he had a blue coat and a long brown beard; hi eye were blue and bright and hi face wa red a a ripe apple but creased into a hundred wrinkle of laughter ,LOTR1,False
3241, in hi hand he carried on a large leaf a on a tray a small pile of white water lilie ,LOTR1,False
3242, cried frodo and sam running toward him with their hand stretched out ,LOTR1,False
3243, cried the old man holding up one hand and they stopped short a if they had been struck stiff ,LOTR1,False
3244, now my little fellow where be you a going to puffing like a bellows ,LOTR1,False
3245, what the matter here then ,LOTR1,False
3246, do you know who i am ,LOTR1,False
3247, tell me what your trouble ,LOTR1,False
3248, tom in a hurry now ,LOTR1,False
3249, dont you crush my lilies ,LOTR1,False
3250, my friend are caught in the willow tree  cried frodo breathlessly ,LOTR1,False
3251, master merry being squeezed in a crack ,LOTR1,False
3252, shouted tom bombadil leaping up in the air ,LOTR1,False
3253, naught worse than that eh ,LOTR1,False
3254, that can soon be mended ,LOTR1,False
3255, i know the tune for him ,LOTR1,False
3256, ill freeze hi marrow cold if he dont behave himself ,LOTR1,False
3257, ill sing hi root off ,LOTR1,False
3258, ill sing a wind up and blow leaf and branch away ,LOTR1,False
3259, setting down hi lilie carefully on the gras he ran to the tree ,LOTR1,False
3260, there he saw merry feet still sticking out the rest had already been drawn further inside ,LOTR1,False
3261, tom put hi mouth to the crack and began singing into it in a low voice ,LOTR1,False
3262, they could not catch the word but evidently merry wa aroused ,LOTR1,False
3263, hi leg began to kick ,LOTR1,False
3264, tom sprang away and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of the willow with it ,LOTR1,False
3265, you let them out again old man willow ,LOTR1,False
3266, what be you a thinking of ,LOTR1,False
3267, you should not be waking ,LOTR1,False
3268, he then seized merry feet and drew him out of the suddenly widening crack ,LOTR1,False
3269, there wa a tearing creak and the other crack split open and out of it pippin sprang a if he had been kicked ,LOTR1,False
3270, then with a loud snap both crack closed fast again ,LOTR1,False
3271, a shudder ran through the tree from root to tip and complete silence fell ,LOTR1,False
3272, said the hobbit one after the other ,LOTR1,False
3273, tom bombadil burst out laughing ,LOTR1,False
3274, said he stooping so that he peered into their face ,LOTR1,False
3275, you shall come home with me ,LOTR1,False
3276, the table i all laden with yellow cream honeycomb and white bread and butter ,LOTR1,False
3277, time enough for question around the supper table ,LOTR1,False
3278, you follow after me a quick a you are able ,LOTR1,False
3279, with that he picked up hi lilie and then with a beckoning wave of hi hand went hopping and dancing along the path eastward still singing loudly and nonsensically ,LOTR1,False
3280, too surprised and too relieved to talk the hobbit followed after him a fast a they could ,LOTR1,False
3281, but that wa not fast enough ,LOTR1,False
3282, tom soon disappeared in front of them and the noise of hi singing got fainter and further away ,LOTR1,False
3283, suddenly hi voice came floating back to them in a loud halloo ,LOTR1,False
3284, hop along my little friend up the withywindle ,LOTR1,False
3285, tom going on ahead candle for to kindle ,LOTR1,False
3286, down west sink the sun: soon you will be groping ,LOTR1,False
3287, when the night shadow fall then the door will open out of the window pane light will twinkle yellow ,LOTR1,False
3288, fear neither root nor bough ,LOTR1,False
3289, tom goe on before you ,LOTR1,False
3290, well be waiting for you ,LOTR1,False
3291, after that the hobbit heard no more ,LOTR1,False
3292, almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the tree behind them ,LOTR1,False
3293, they thought of the slanting light of evening glittering on the brandywine river and the window of bucklebury beginning to gleam with hundred of light ,LOTR1,False
3294, great shadow fell acros them; trunk and branche of tree hung dark and threatening over the path ,LOTR1,False
3295, white mist began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the root of the tree upon it border ,LOTR1,False
3296, out of the very ground at their feet a shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk ,LOTR1,False
3297, it became difficult to follow the path and they were very tired ,LOTR1,False
3298, strange furtive noise ran among the bushe and reed on either side of them; and if they looked up to the pale sky they caught sight of queer gnarled and knobbly face that gloomed dark against the twilight and leered down at them from the high bank and the edge of the wood ,LOTR1,False
3299, they began to feel that all thi country wa unreal and that they were stumbling through an ominou dream that led to no awakening ,LOTR1,False
3300, just a they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill they noticed that the ground wa gently rising ,LOTR1,False
3301, the water began to murmur ,LOTR1,False
3302, in the darkn they caught the white glimmer of foam where the river flowed over a short fall ,LOTR1,False
3303, then suddenly the tree came to an end and the mist were left behind ,LOTR1,False
3304, they stepped out from the forest and found a wide sweep of gras welling up before them ,LOTR1,False
3305, the river now small and swift wa leaping merrily down to meet them glinting here and there in the light of the star which were already shining in the sky ,LOTR1,False
3306, the gras under their feet wa smooth and short a if it had been mown or shaven ,LOTR1,False
3307, the eave of the forest behind were clipped and trim a a hedge ,LOTR1,False
3308, the path wa now plain before them well tended and bordered with stone ,LOTR1,False
3309, it wound up on to the top of a grassy knoll now grey under the pale starry night; and there still high above them on a further slope they saw the twinkling light of a house ,LOTR1,False
3310, down again the path went and then up again up a long smooth hillside of turf toward the light ,LOTR1,False
3311, suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that wa opened ,LOTR1,False
3312, there wa tom bombadil house before them up down under hill ,LOTR1,False
3313, behind it a steep shoulder of the land lay grey and bare and beyond that the dark shape of the barrow down stalked away into the eastern night ,LOTR1,False

3555, suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared ,LOTR1,False
3556, quickly he returned bearing a large and laden tray ,LOTR1,False
3557, then tom and goldberry set the table; and the hobbit sat half in wonder and half in laughter: so fair wa the grace of goldberry and so merry and odd the capering of tom ,LOTR1,False
3558, yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance neither hindering the other in and out of the room and round about the table; and with great speed food and vessel and light were set in order ,LOTR1,False
3559, the board blazed with candle white and yellow ,LOTR1,False
3560, tom bowed to hi guest ,LOTR1,False
3561, supper i ready  said goldberry; and now the hobbit saw that she wa clothed all in silver with a white girdle and her shoe were like fishes mail ,LOTR1,False
3562, but tom wa all in clean blue blue a rain washed forget me not and he had green stocking ,LOTR1,False
3563, it wa a supper even better than before ,LOTR1,False
3564, the hobbit under the spell of tom word may have missed one meal or many but when the food wa before them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten ,LOTR1,False
3565, they did not sing or even speak much for a while and paid close attention to busin ,LOTR1,False
3566, but after a time their heart and spirit rose high again and their voice rang out in mirth and laughter ,LOTR1,False
3567, after they had eaten goldberry sang many song for them song that began merrily in the hill and fell softly down into silence; and in the silence they saw in their mind pool and water wider than any they had known and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the star like jewel in the depth ,LOTR1,False
3568, then once more she wished them each good night and left them by the fireside ,LOTR1,False
3569, but tom now seemed wide awake and plied them with question ,LOTR1,False
3570, he appeared already to know much about them and all their familie and indeed to know much of all the history and doing of the shire down from day hardly remembered among the hobbit themselve ,LOTR1,False
3571, it no longer surprised them; but he made no secret that he owed hi recent knowledge largely to farmer maggot whom he seemed to regard a a person of more importance than they had imagined ,LOTR1,False
3572, there earth under hi old feet and clay on hi fingers; wisdom in hi bone and both hi eye are open  said tom ,LOTR1,False
3573, it wa also clear that tom had dealing with the elve and it seemed that in some fashion new had reached him from gildor concerning the flight of frodo ,LOTR1,False
3574, indeed so much did tom know and so cunning wa hi questioning that frodo found himself telling him more about bilbo and hi own hope and fear than he had told before even to gandalf ,LOTR1,False
3575, tom wagged hi head up and down and there wa a glint in hi eye when he heard of the rider ,LOTR1,False
3576, show me the preciou ring ,LOTR1,False
3577, he said suddenly in the midst of the story: and frodo to hi own astonishment drew out the chain from hi pocket and unfastening the ring handed it at once to tom ,LOTR1,False
3578, it seemed to grow larger a it lay for a moment on hi big brown skinned hand ,LOTR1,False
3579, then suddenly he put it to hi eye and laughed ,LOTR1,False
3580, for a second the hobbit had a vision both comical and alarming of hi bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold ,LOTR1,False
3581, then tom put the ring round the end of hi little finger and held it up to the candlelight ,LOTR1,False
3582, for a moment the hobbit noticed nothing strange about thi ,LOTR1,False
3583, there wa no sign of tom disappearing ,LOTR1,False
3584, tom laughed again and then he spun the ring in the air and it vanished with a flash ,LOTR1,False
3585, frodo gave a cry and tom leaned forward and handed it back to him with a smile ,LOTR1,False
3586, frodo looked at it closely and rather suspiciously (like one who ha lent a trinket to a juggler) ,LOTR1,False
3587, it wa the same ring or looked the same and weighed the same: for that ring had alway seemed to frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand ,LOTR1,False
3588, but something prompted him to make sure ,LOTR1,False
3589, he wa perhap a trifle annoyed with tom for seeming to make so light of what even gandalf thought so perilously important ,LOTR1,False
3590, he waited for an opportunity when the talk wa going again and tom wa telling an absurd story about badger and their queer way then he slipped the ring on ,LOTR1,False
3591, merry turned toward him to say something and gave a start and checked an exclamation ,LOTR1,False
3592, frodo wa delighted (in a way): it wa hi own ring all right for merry wa staring blankly at hi chair and obviously could not see him ,LOTR1,False
3593, he got up and crept quietly away from the fireside toward the outer door ,LOTR1,False
3594, cried tom glancing toward him with a most seeing look in hi shining eye ,LOTR1,False
3595, where be you a going ,LOTR1,False
3596, old tom bombadil not a blind a that yet ,LOTR1,False
3597, take off your golden ring ,LOTR1,False
3598, your hand more fair without it ,LOTR1,False
3599, leave your game and sit down beside me ,LOTR1,False
3600, we must talk a while more and think about the morning ,LOTR1,False
3601, tom must teach the right road and keep your feet from wandering ,LOTR1,False
3602, frodo laughed (trying to feel pleased) and taking off the ring he came and sat down again ,LOTR1,False
3603, tom now told them that he reckoned the sun would shine tomorrow and it would be a glad morning and setting out would be hopeful ,LOTR1,False
3604, but they would do well to start early; for weather in that country wa a thing that even tom could not be sure of for long and it would change sometime quicker than he could change hi jacket ,LOTR1,False
3605, i am no weather master  he said; nor i aught that goe on two leg ,LOTR1,False
3606, by hi advice they decided to make nearly due north from hi house over the western and lower slope of the downs: they might hope in that way to strike the east road in a day journey and avoid the barrow ,LOTR1,False
3607, he told them not to be afraid but to mind their own busin ,LOTR1,False
3608, keep to the green gras ,LOTR1,False
3609, dont you go a meddling with old stone or cold wight or prying in their house unl you be strong folk with heart that never falter ,LOTR1,False
3610, he said thi more than once; and he advised them to pas barrow by on the west side if they chanced to stray near one ,LOTR1,False
3611, then he taught them a rhyme to sing if they should by ill luck fall into any danger or difficulty the next day ,LOTR1,False
3612, by water wood and hill by the reed and willow by fire sun and moon harken now and hear us ,LOTR1,False
3613, come tom bombadil for our need i near us ,LOTR1,False
3614, when they had sung thi altogether after him he clapped them each on the shoulder with a laugh and taking candle led them back to their bedroom ,LOTR1,False
3615, fog on the barrow down that night they heard no noise ,LOTR1,False
3616, but either in hi dream or out of them he could not tell which frodo heard a sweet singing running in hi mind; a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey rain curtain and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glas and silver until at last it wa rolled back and a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrise ,LOTR1,False
3617, the vision melted into waking; and there wa tom whistling like a tree full of birds; and the sun wa already slanting down the hill and through the open window ,LOTR1,False
3618, outside everything wa green and pale gold ,LOTR1,False
3619, after breakfast which they again ate alone they made ready to say farewell a nearly heavy of heart a wa possible on such a morning: cool bright and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue ,LOTR1,False
3620, the air came fresh from the north west ,LOTR1,False
3621, their quiet ponie were almost frisky sniffing and moving restlessly ,LOTR1,False
3622, tom came out of the house and waved hi hat and danced upon the doorstep bidding the hobbit to get up and be off and go with good speed ,LOTR1,False
3623, they rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house and went slanting up toward the north end of the hill brow under which it sheltered ,LOTR1,False
3624, they had just dismounted to lead their ponie up the last steep slope when suddenly frodo stopped ,LOTR1,False
3625, my fair lady clad all in silver green ,LOTR1,False
3626, we have never said farewell to her nor seen her since the evening ,LOTR1,False
3627, he wa so distressed that he turned back; but at that moment a clear call came rippling down ,LOTR1,False
3628, there on the hill brow she stood beckoning to them: her hair wa flying loose and a it caught the sun it shone and shimmered ,LOTR1,False
3629, a light like the glint of water on dewy gras flashed from under her feet a she danced ,LOTR1,False
3630, they hastened up the last slope and stood breathl beside her ,LOTR1,False
3631, they bowed but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round; and they looked out from the hill top over land under the morning ,LOTR1,False
3632, it wa now a clear and far seen a it had been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll in the forest which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark tree in the west ,LOTR1,False
3633, in that direction the land rose in wooded ridge green yellow russet under the sun beyond which lay hidden the valley of the brandywine ,LOTR1,False
3634, to the south over the line of the withywindle there wa a distant glint like pale glas where the brandywine river made a great loop in the lowland and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbit ,LOTR1,False
3635, northward beyond the dwindling down the land ran away in flat and swelling of grey and green and pale earth colour until it faded into a featurel and shadowy distance ,LOTR1,False
3636, eastward the barrow down rose ridge behind ridge into the morning and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it wa no more than a gu of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with the hem of the sky but it spoke to them out of memory and old tale of the high and distant mountain ,LOTR1,False
3637, they took a deep draught of the air and felt that a skip and a few stout stride would bear them wherever they wished ,LOTR1,False
3638, it seemed fainthearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirt of the down toward the road when they should be leaping a lusty a tom over the stepping stone of the hill straight toward the mountain ,LOTR1,False
3639, goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eye and thought ,LOTR1,False
3640, and hold to your purpose ,LOTR1,False
3641, north with the wind in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps ,LOTR1,False
3642, make haste while the sun shines ,LOTR1,False
3643, and to frodo she said: farewell elf friend it wa a merry meeting ,LOTR1,False
3644, but frodo found no word to answer ,LOTR1,False
3645, he bowed low and mounted hi pony and followed by hi friend jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill ,LOTR1,False
3646, tom bombadil house and the valley and the forest were lost to view ,LOTR1,False
3647, the air grew warmer between the green wall of hillside and hillside and the scent of turf rose strong and sweet a they breathed ,LOTR1,False
3648, turning back when they reached the bottom of the green hollow they saw goldberry now small and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky: she wa standing still watching them and her hand were stretched out toward them ,LOTR1,False
3649, a they looked she gave a clear call and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hill ,LOTR1,False
3650, their way wound along the floor of the hollow and round the green feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley and then over the shoulder of further hill and down their long limb and up their smooth side again up on to new hill top and down into new valley ,LOTR1,False
3651, there wa no tree nor any visible water: it wa a country of gras and short springy turf silent except for the whisper of the air over the edge of the land and high lonely crie of strange bird ,LOTR1,False
3652, a they journeyed the sun mounted and grew hot ,LOTR1,False
3653, each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown l ,LOTR1,False
3654, when they caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant forest seemed to be smoking a if the fallen rain wa steaming up again from leaf and root and mould ,LOTR1,False
3655, a shadow now lay round the edge of sight a dark haze above which the upper sky wa like a blue cap hot and heavy ,LOTR1,False
3656, about mid day they came to a hill whose top wa wide and flattened like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim ,LOTR1,False
3657, inside there wa no air stirring and the sky seemed near their head ,LOTR1,False
3658, they rode acros and looked northward ,LOTR1,False
3659, then their heart rose for it seemed plain that they had come further already than they had expected ,LOTR1,False
3660, certainly the distance had now all become hazy and deceptive but there could be no doubt that the down were coming to an end ,LOTR1,False
3661, a long valley lay below them winding away northward until it came to an opening between two steep shoulder ,LOTR1,False
3662, beyond there seemed to be no more hill ,LOTR1,False
3663, due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line ,LOTR1,False
3664, that i a line of tree  said merry and that must mark the road ,LOTR1,False
3665, all along it for many league east of the bridge there are tree growing ,LOTR1,False
3666, some say they were planted in the old day ,LOTR1,False
3667, if we make a good going thi afternoon a we have done thi morning we shall have left the down before the sun set and be jogging on in search of a camping place ,LOTR1,False
3668, but even a he spoke he turned hi glance eastward and he saw that on that side the hill were higher and looked down upon them; and all those hill were crowned with green mound and on some were standing stone pointing upward like jagged teeth out of green gum that view wa somehow disquieting; so they turned from the sight and went down into the hollow circle ,LOTR1,False
3669, in the midst of it there stood a single stone standing tall under the sun above and at thi hour casting no shadow ,LOTR1,False
3670, it wa shapel and yet significant: like a landmark or a guarding finger or more like a warning ,LOTR1,False
3671, but they were now hungry and the sun wa still at the fearl noon; so they set their back against the east side of the stone ,LOTR1,False
3672, it wa cool a if the sun had had no power to warm it; but at that time thi seemed pleasant ,LOTR1,False
3673, there they took food and drink and made a good a noon meal under the open sky a anyone could wish; for the food came from down under hill ,LOTR1,False
3674, tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of the day ,LOTR1,False
3675, their ponie unburdened strayed upon the gras ,LOTR1,False
3676, riding over the hill and eating their fill the warm sun and the scent of turf lying a little too long stretching out their leg and looking at the sky above their noses: these thing are perhap enough to explain what happened ,LOTR1,False
3677, however that may be: they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take ,LOTR1,False
3678, the standing stone wa cold and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them ,LOTR1,False
3679, the sun a pale and watery yellow wa gleaming through the mist just above the west wall of the hollow in which they lay; north south and east beyond the wall the fog wa thick cold and white ,LOTR1,False
3680, the air wa silent heavy and chill ,LOTR1,False
3681, their ponie were standing crowded together with their head down ,LOTR1,False
3682, the hobbit sprang to their feet in alarm and ran to the western rim ,LOTR1,False
3683, they found that they were upon an island in the fog ,LOTR1,False
3684, even a they looked out in dismay toward the setting sun it sank before their eye into a white sea and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the east behind ,LOTR1,False
3685, the fog rolled up to the wall and rose above them and a it mounted it bent over their head until it became a roof: they were shut in a hall of mist whose central pillar wa the standing stone ,LOTR1,False
3686, they felt a if a trap wa closing about them; but they did not quite lose heart ,LOTR1,False
3687, they still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line of the road ahead and they still knew in which direction it lay ,LOTR1,False
3688, in any case they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone that no thought of remaining there wa in their mind ,LOTR1,False
3689, they packed up a quickly a their chilled finger would work ,LOTR1,False
3690, soon they were leading their ponie in single file over the rim and down the long northward slope of the hill down into a foggy sea ,LOTR1,False
3691, a they went down the mist became colder and damper and their hair hung lank and dripping on their forehead ,LOTR1,False
3692, when they reached the bottom it wa so cold that they halted and got out cloak and hood which soon became bedewed with grey drop ,LOTR1,False
3693, then mounting their ponie they went slowly on again feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground ,LOTR1,False
3694, they were steering a well a they could gu for the gate like opening at the far northward end of the long valley which they had seen in the morning ,LOTR1,False
3695, once they were through the gap they had only lo keep on in anything like a straight line and they were bound in the end to strike the road ,LOTR1,False
3696, their thought did not go beyond that except for a vague hope that perhap away beyond the down there might be no fog ,LOTR1,False
3697, their going wa very slow ,LOTR1,False
3698, to prevent their getting separated and wandering in different direction they went in file with frodo leading ,LOTR1,False
3699, sam wa behind him and after him came pippin and then merry ,LOTR1,False
3700, the valley seemed to stretch on endlessly ,LOTR1,False
3701, suddenly frodo saw a hopeful sign ,LOTR1,False
3702, on either side ahead a darkn began to loom through the mist; and he guessed that they were at last approaching the gap in the hill the north gate of the barrow down ,LOTR1,False
3703, if they could pas that they would be free ,LOTR1,False
3704, he called back over hi shoulder and he hurried forward ,LOTR1,False
3705, but hi hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm ,LOTR1,False
3706, the dark patche grew darker but they shrank; and suddenly he saw towering ominou before him and leaning slightly toward one another like the pillar of a headl door two huge standing stone ,LOTR1,False
3707, he could not remember having seen any sign of these in the valley when he looked out from the hill in the morning ,LOTR1,False
3708, he had passed between them almost before he wa aware: and even a he did so darkn seemed to fall round him ,LOTR1,False
3709, hi pony reared and snorted and he fell off ,LOTR1,False
3710, when he looked back he found that he wa alone: the other had not followed him ,LOTR1,False
3711, why dont you keep up ,LOTR1,False
3712, fear took him and he ran back past the stone shouting wildly: sam ,LOTR1,False
3713, the pony bolted into the mist and vanished ,LOTR1,False
3714, from some way off or so it seemed he thought he heard a cry: hoy ,LOTR1,False
3715, it wa away eastward on hi left a he stood under the great stone staring and straining into the gloom ,LOTR1,False
3716, he plunged off in the direction of the call and found himself going steeply uphill ,LOTR1,False
3717, a he struggled on he called again and kept on calling more and more frantically; but he heard no answer for some time and then it seemed faint and far ahead and high above him ,LOTR1,False
3718, came the thin voice out of the mist: and then a cry that sounded like help help ,LOTR1,False
3719, often repeated ending with a last help ,LOTR1,False
3720, that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut short ,LOTR1,False
3721, he stumbled forward with all the speed he could toward the cries; but the light wa now gone and clinging night had closed about him so that it wa impossible to be sure of any direction ,LOTR1,False
3722, he seemed all the time to be climbing up and up ,LOTR1,False
3723, only the change in the level of the ground at hi feet told him when he at last came to the top of a ridge or hill ,LOTR1,False
3724, he wa weary sweating and yet chilled ,LOTR1,False
3725, he wa suddenly aware that it wa getting very cold and that up here a wind wa beginning to blow an icy wind ,LOTR1,False
3726, a change wa coming in the weather ,LOTR1,False
3727, the mist wa flowing past him now in shred and tatter ,LOTR1,False
3728, hi breath wa smoking and the darkn wa l near and thick ,LOTR1,False
3729, he looked up and saw with surprise that faint star were appearing overhead amid the strand of hurrying cloud and fog ,LOTR1,False
3730, the wind began to his over the gras ,LOTR1,False
3731, he imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry and he made toward it; and even a he went forward the mist wa rolled up and thrust aside and the starry sky wa unveiled ,LOTR1,False
3732, a glance showed him that he wa now facing southward and wa on a round hill top which he must have climbed from the north ,LOTR1,False
3733, out of the east the biting wind wa blowing ,LOTR1,False
3734, to hi right there loomed against the westward star a dark black shape ,LOTR1,False
3735, a great barrow stood there ,LOTR1,False
3736, he cried again both angry and afraid ,LOTR1,False
3737, said a voice deep and cold that seemed to come out of the ground ,LOTR1,False
3738, i am waiting for you ,LOTR1,False
3739, said frodo; but he did not run away ,LOTR1,False
3740, hi knee gave and he fell on the ground ,LOTR1,False
3741, nothing happened and there wa no sound ,LOTR1,False
3742, trembling he looked up in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the star ,LOTR1,False
3743, he thought there were two eye very cold though lit with a pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance ,LOTR1,False
3744, then a grip stronger and colder than iron seized him ,LOTR1,False
3745, the icy touch froze hi bone and he remembered no more ,LOTR1,False
3746, when he came to himself again for a moment he could recall nothing except a sense of dread ,LOTR1,False
3747, then suddenly he knew that he wa imprisoned caught hopelessly; he wa in a barrow ,LOTR1,False
3748, a barrow wight had taken him and he wa probably already under the dreadful spell of the barrow wight about which whispered tale spoke ,LOTR1,False
3749, he dared not move but lay a he found himself: flat on hi back upon a cold stone with hi hand on hi breast ,LOTR1,False
3750, but though hi fear wa so great that it seemed to be part of the very darkn that wa round him he found himself a he lay thinking about bilbo baggin and hi storie of their jogging along together in the lane of the shire and talking about road and adventure ,LOTR1,False
3751, there i a seed of courage hidden (often deeply it i true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid hobbit wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow ,LOTR1,False
3752, frodo wa neither very fat nor very timid; indeed though he did not know it bilbo (and gandalf) had thought him the best hobbit in the shire ,LOTR1,False
3753, he thought he had come to the end of hi adventure and a terrible end but the thought hardened him ,LOTR1,False
3754, he found himself stiffening a if for a final spring; he no longer felt limp like a helpl prey ,LOTR1,False
3755, a he lay there thinking and getting a hold of himself he noticed all at once that the darkn wa slowly giving way: a pale greenish light wa growing round him ,LOTR1,False
3756, it did not at first show him what kind of a place he wa in for the light seemed to be coming out of himself and from the floor beside him and had not yet reached the roof or wall ,LOTR1,False
3757, he turned and there in the cold glow he saw lying beside him sam pippin and merry ,LOTR1,False
3758, they were on their back and their face looked deathly pale; and they were clad in white ,LOTR1,False
3759, about them lay many treasure of gold maybe though in that light they looked cold and unlovely ,LOTR1,False
3760, on their head were circlet gold chain were about their waist and on their finger were many ring ,LOTR1,False
3761, sword lay by their side and shield were at their feet ,LOTR1,False
3762, but acros their three neck lay one long naked sword ,LOTR1,False
3763, suddenly a song began: a cold murmur rising and falling ,LOTR1,False
3764, the voice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary sometime high in the air and thin sometime like a low moan from the ground ,LOTR1,False
3765, out of the forml stream of sad but horrible sound string of word would now and again shape themselves: grim hard cold word heartl and miserable ,LOTR1,False
3766, the night wa railing against the morning of which it wa bereaved and the cold wa cursing the warmth for which it hungered ,LOTR1,False
3767, frodo wa chilled to the marrow ,LOTR1,False
3768, after a while the song became clearer and with dread in hi heart he perceived that it had changed into an incantation: cold be hand and heart and bone and cold be sleep under stone: never mare to wake on stony bed never till the sun fail and the moon i dead ,LOTR1,False
3769, in the black wind the star shall die and still on gold here let them lie till the dark lord lift hi hand over dead sea and withered land ,LOTR1,False
3770, he heard behind hi head a creaking and scraping sound ,LOTR1,False
3771, raising himself on one arm he looked and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind of passage which behind them turned a corner ,LOTR1,False
3772, round the corner a long arm wa groping walking on it finger toward sam who wa lying nearest and toward the hilt of the sword that lay upon him ,LOTR1,False
3773, at first frodo felt a if he had indeed been turned into stone by the incantation ,LOTR1,False
3774, then a wild thought of escape came to him ,LOTR1,False
3775, he wondered if he put on the ring whether the barrow wight would mis him and he might find some way out ,LOTR1,False
3776, he thought of himself running free over the gras grieving for merry and sam and pippin but free and alive himself ,LOTR1,False
3777, gandalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do ,LOTR1,False
3778, but the courage that had been awakened in him wa now too strong: he could not leave hi friend so easily ,LOTR1,False
3779, he wavered groping in hi pocket and then fought with himself again; and a he did so the arm crept nearer ,LOTR1,False
3780, suddenly resolve hardened in him and he seized a short sword that lay beside him and kneeling he stooped low over the bodie of hi companion ,LOTR1,False
3781, with what strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist and the hand broke off; but at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilt ,LOTR1,False
3782, there wa a shriek and the light vanished ,LOTR1,False
3783, in the dark there wa a snarling noise ,LOTR1,False
3784, frodo fell forward over merry and merry face felt cold ,LOTR1,False
3785, all at once back into hi mind from which it had disappeared with the first coming of the fog came the memory of the house down under the hill and of tom singing ,LOTR1,False
3786, he remembered the rhyme that tom had taught them ,LOTR1,False
3787, in a small desperate voice he began: ho ,LOTR1,False
3788, and with that name hi voice seemed to grow strong: it had a full and lively sound and the dark chamber echoed a if to drum and trumpet ,LOTR1,False
3789, by water wood and hill by the reed and willow by fire sun and moon harken now and hear us ,LOTR1,False
3790, come tom bombadil for our need i near us ,LOTR1,False
3791, there wa a sudden deep silence in which frodo could hear hi heart beating ,LOTR1,False

4133, frodo did not prove very communicative and he soon found himself sitting alone in a comer listening and looking around ,LOTR1,False
4134, the men and dwarve were mostly talking of distant event and telling flew of a kind that wa becoming only too familiar ,LOTR1,False
4135, there wa trouble away in the south and it seemed that the men who had come up the greenway were on the move looking for land where they could find some peace ,LOTR1,False

4145, but there were several question asked that made frodo a little uneasy ,LOTR1,False
4146, one of the bree lander who seemed to have been in the shire several time wanted to know where the underhill lived and who they were related to ,LOTR1,False
4147, suddenly frodo noticed that a strange looking weather beaten man sitting in the shadow near the wall wa also listening intently to the hobbit talk ,LOTR1,False

4149, hi leg were stretched out before him showing high boot of supple leather that fitted him well but had seen much wear and were now caked with mud ,LOTR1,False
4150, a travel stained cloak of heavy dark green cloth wa drawn close about him and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a hood that overshadowed hi face; but the gleam of hi eye could be seen a he watched the hobbit ,LOTR1,False
4151, frodo asked when he got a chance to whisper to mr butterbur ,LOTR1,False
4152, i dont think you introduced him ,LOTR1,False

4161, funny you should ask about him ,LOTR1,False
4162, but at that moment mr butterbur wa called away by a demand for more ale and hi last remark remained unexplained ,LOTR1,False
4163, frodo found that strider wa now looking at him a if he had heard or guessed all that had been said ,LOTR1,False
4164, presently with a wave of hi hand and a nod he invited frodo to come over and sit by him ,LOTR1,False
4165, a frodo drew near be threw back hi hood showing a shaggy head of dark hair necked with grey and in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eye ,LOTR1,False

4176, frodo returned hi gaze but said nothing; and strider made no further sign ,LOTR1,False
4177, hi attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on pippin ,LOTR1,False
4178, to hi alarm frodo became aware that the ridiculou young took encouraged by hi succ with the fat mayor of michel delving wa now actually giving a comic account of bilbo farewell party ,LOTR1,False
4179, he wa already giving an imitation of the speech and wa drawing near to the astonishing disappearance ,LOTR1,False
4180, it wa a harml enough tale for most of the local hobbit no doubt: just a funny story about those funny people away beyond the river; but some (old butterbur for instance) knew a thing or two and had probably heard rumour long ago about bilbo vanishing ,LOTR1,False
4181, it would bring the name of baggin to their mind especially if there had been inquirie in bree after that name ,LOTR1,False
4182, frodo fidgeted wondering what to do ,LOTR1,False
4183, pippin wa evidently much enjoying the attention he wa getting and had become quite forgetful of their danger ,LOTR1,False
4184, frodo had a sudden fear that in hi present mood he might even mention the ring; and that might well be disastrou ,LOTR1,False
4185, you had better do something quick ,LOTR1,False
4186, whispered strider in hi ear ,LOTR1,False
4187, frodo jumped up and stood on a table and began to talk ,LOTR1,False
4188, the attention of pippin audience wa disturbed ,LOTR1,False
4189, some of the hobbit looked at frodo and laughed and clapped thinking that mr underhill had taken a much ale a wa good for him ,LOTR1,False
4190, frodo suddenly felt very foolish and found himself (a wa hi habit when making a speech) fingering the thing in hi pocket ,LOTR1,False
4191, he felt the ring on it chain and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on and vanish out of the silly situation ,LOTR1,False
4192, it seemed to him somehow a if me suggestion came to him from outside from someone or something a the room ,LOTR1,False
4193, he resisted the temptation firmly and clasped the ring in hi hand a if to keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief ,LOTR1,False
4194, at any rate it gave him no inspiration ,LOTR1,False
4195, he spoke a few suitable words a they would have said in the shire: we are all very much gratified by the kindn of your reception and i venture to hope that my brief visit will help to renew the old tie of friendship between the shire and bree; and then he hesitated and coughed ,LOTR1,False
4196, everyone in the room wa now looking at him ,LOTR1,False
4197, shouted one of the hobbit ,LOTR1,False
4198, come on now master sing u something that we havent heard before ,LOTR1,False
4199, for a moment frodo stood gaping ,LOTR1,False
4200, then in desperation he began a ridiculou song that bilbo had been rather fond of (and indeed rather proud of for he had made up the word himself) ,LOTR1,False
4201, it wa about an inn; and that i probably why it came into frodo mind just then ,LOTR1,False
4202, here it i in full ,LOTR1,False
4203, only a few word of it are now a a rule remembered ,LOTR1,False
4204, there i an inn a merry old inn beneath an old grey hill and there they brew a beer so brown that the man in the moon himself came down one night to drink hi fill ,LOTR1,False

4208, the row of silver dishe and the store of silver spoons ,LOTR1,False
4209, for sunday* there a special pair and these they polish up with care on saturday afternoon ,LOTR1,False
4210, the man in the moon wa drinking deep and the cat began to wail; a dish and a spoon on the table danced the cow in the garden madly pranced and the little dog chased hi tail ,LOTR1,False
4211, the man in the moon took another mug and then rolled beneath hi chair; and there he dozed and dreamed of ale till in the sky the star were pale and dawn wa in the air ,LOTR1,False
4212, then the ostler said to hi tipsy cat: the white horse of the moon they neigh and champ their silver bits; but their master been and drowned hi wit and the sunll be rising soon ,LOTR1,False
4213, so the cat on hi fiddle played hey diddle diddle a jig that would wake the dead: he squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune while the landlord shook the man in the moon: it after three ,LOTR1,False
4214, they rolled the man slowly up the hill and bundled him into the moon while hi horse galloped up in rear and the cow came capering like a deer and a dish ran up with the spoon ,LOTR1,False
4215, now quicker the fiddle went deedle dum diddle; the dog began to roar the cow and the horse stood on their heads; the guest all bounded from their bed and danced upon the floor ,LOTR1,False
4216, with a ping and a pong the fiddle string broke ,LOTR1,False
4217, the cow jumped over the moon and the little dog laughed to see such fun and the saturday dish went off at a run with the silver sunday spoon ,LOTR1,False
4218, the round moon rolled behind the hill a the sun raised up her head ,LOTR1,False
4219, she * hardly believed her fiery eyes; for though it wa day to her surprise they all went back to bed ,LOTR1,False
4220, there wa loud and long applause ,LOTR1,False
4221, frodo had a good voice and the song tickled their fancy ,LOTR1,False
4222, he ought to hear thi ,LOTR1,False
4223, bob ought to learn hi cat the fiddle and then wed have a dance ,LOTR1,False
4224, they called for more ale and began to shout: let have it again master ,LOTR1,False
4225, they made frodo have another drink and then begin hi song again while many of them joined in; for the tune wa well known and they were quick at picking up word ,LOTR1,False
4226, it wa now frodo turn to feel pleased with himself ,LOTR1,False
4227, he capered about on the table; and when he came a second time to the cow jumped over the moon he leaped in the air ,LOTR1,False
4228, much too vigorously; for he came down bang into a tray full of mug and slipped and rolled off the table with a crash clatter and bump ,LOTR1,False
4229, the audience all opened their mouth wide for laughter and stopped short a gaping silence; for the singer disappeared ,LOTR1,False
4230, he simply vanished a if he had gone slap through the floor without leaving a hole  ,LOTR1,False
4231, the local hobbit stared in amazement and then sprang to their feet and shouted for barliman ,LOTR1,False
4232, all the company drew away from pippin and sam who found themselve left alone in a comer and eyed darkly and doubtfully from a distance ,LOTR1,False
4233, it wa plain that many people regarded them now a the companion of a travelling magician of unknown power and purpose ,LOTR1,False
4234, but there wa one swarthy bree lander who stood looking at them with a knowing and half mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable ,LOTR1,False
4235, presently he slipped out of the door followed by the squint eyed southerner: the two had been whispering together a good deal during the evening ,LOTR1,False
4236, harry the gatekeeper also went out just behind them ,LOTR1,False
4237, not knowing what else to do he crawled away under the table to the dark comer by strider who sat unmoved giving no sign of hi thought ,LOTR1,False
4238, frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the ring ,LOTR1,False
4239, how it came to be on hi finger he could not tell ,LOTR1,False
4240, he could only suppose that he had been handling it in hi pocket while he sang and that somehow it had slipped on when he stuck out hi hand with a jerk to save hi fall ,LOTR1,False
4241, for a moment he wondered if the ring itself had not played him a trick; perhap it had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that wa felt in the room ,LOTR1,False
4242, he did not like the look of the men that had gone out ,LOTR1,False
4243, said strider when he reappeared ,LOTR1,False
4244, why did you do that ,LOTR1,False
4245, worse than anything your friend could have said ,LOTR1,False
4246, you have put your foot in it ,LOTR1,False
4247, or should i say your finger ,LOTR1,False
4248, i dont know what you mean  said frodo annoyed and alarmed ,LOTR1,False
4249, oh ye you do  answered strider; but we had better wait until the uproar ha died down ,LOTR1,False
4250, then if you please mr baggin i should like a quiet word with you ,LOTR1,False
4251, asked frodo ignoring the sudden use of hi proper name ,LOTR1,False
4252, a matter of some importance to u both  answered strider looking frodo in the eye ,LOTR1,False
4253, you may hear something to your advantage ,LOTR1,False
4254, very well  said frodo trying to appear unconcerned ,LOTR1,False
4255, ill talk to you later ,LOTR1,False
4256, meanwhile an argument wa going on by the fireplace ,LOTR1,False
4257, mr butterbur had come trotting in and he wa now trying to listen to several conflicting account of the event at the same time ,LOTR1,False
4258, i saw him mr butterbur  said a hobbit; or leastway i didnt see him if you take my meaning ,LOTR1,False
4259, he just vanished into thin air in a manner of speaking ,LOTR1,False
4260, you dont say mr mugwort ,LOTR1,False

4262, and i mean what i say what more ,LOTR1,False

4270, of course there a mistake ,LOTR1,False
4271, ive just been having a few word with strider in the comer ,LOTR1,False
4272, he came forward into the firelight; but most of the company backed away even more perturbed than before ,LOTR1,False
4273, they were not in the least satisfied by hi explanation that he had crawled away quickly under the table after he had fallen ,LOTR1,False
4274, most of the hobbit and the men of bree went off then and there in a huff having no fancy for further entertainment that evening ,LOTR1,False
4275, one or two gave frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselve ,LOTR1,False
4276, the dwarve and the two or three strange men that still remained got up and said good night to the landlord but not to frodo and hi friend ,LOTR1,False
4277, before long no one wa left but strider who sat on unnoticed by the wall ,LOTR1,False
4278, mr butterbur did not seem much put out ,LOTR1,False

4577, and you would die first unl you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be ,LOTR1,False
4578, pippin subsided; but sam wa not daunted and he still eyed strider dubiously ,LOTR1,False

4718, strider built up the fire and blew out all the candle ,LOTR1,False
4719, the hobbit lay down on their blanket with their feet toward the hearth; but strider settled himself in the chair against the door ,LOTR1,False

4724, the worthie of bree will be discussing it a hundred year hence ,LOTR1,False
4725, i hope so  said strider ,LOTR1,False
4726, then they all fell silent and one by one the hobbit dropped off to sleep ,LOTR1,False
4727, a knife in the dark a they prepared for sleep in the inn at bree darkn lay on buckland; a mist strayed in the dell and along the river bank ,LOTR1,False
4728, the house at crickhollow stood silent ,LOTR1,False
4729, fatty bolger opened the door cautiously and peered out ,LOTR1,False
4730, a feeling of fear had been growing on him all day and he wa unable to rest or go to bed: there wa a brooding threat in the breathl night air ,LOTR1,False
4731, a he stared out into the gloom a black shadow moved under the trees; the gate seemed to open of it own accord and close again without a sound ,LOTR1,False
4732, he shrank back and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall ,LOTR1,False
4733, then he shut and locked the door ,LOTR1,False
4734, there came the soft sound of horse led with stealth along the lane ,LOTR1,False
4735, outside the gate they stopped and three black figure entered like shade of night creeping acros the ground ,LOTR1,False
4736, one went to the door one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they stood a still a the shadow of stone while night went slowly on ,LOTR1,False
4737, the house and the quiet tree seemed to be waiting breathlessly ,LOTR1,False
4738, there wa a faint stir in the leave and a cock crowed far away ,LOTR1,False
4739, the cold hour before dawn wa passing ,LOTR1,False
4740, the figure by the door moved ,LOTR1,False
4741, in the dark without moon or star a drawn blade gleamed a if a chill light had been unsheathed ,LOTR1,False
4742, there wa a blow soft but heavy and the door shuddered ,LOTR1,False
4743, open in the name of mordor ,LOTR1,False
4744, said a voice thin and menacing ,LOTR1,False
4745, at a second blow the door yielded and fell back with timber burst and lock broken ,LOTR1,False
4746, the black figure passed swiftly in ,LOTR1,False
4747, at that moment among the tree nearby a horn rang out ,LOTR1,False
4748, it rent the night like fire on a hill top ,LOTR1,False
4749, fatty bolger had not been idle ,LOTR1,False
4750, a soon a he saw the dark shape creep from the garden he knew that he must run for it or perish ,LOTR1,False
4751, and run he did out of the back door through the garden and over the field ,LOTR1,False
4752, when he reached the nearest house more than a mile away he collapsed on the doorstep ,LOTR1,False
4753, it wa some time before anyone could make out what he wa babbling about ,LOTR1,False
4754, at last they got the idea that enemie were in buckland some strange invasion from the old forest ,LOTR1,False
4755, and then they lost no more time ,LOTR1,False
4756, the brandybuck were blowing the horn call of buckland that had not been sounded for a hundred year not since the white wolve came in the fell winter when the brandywine wa frozen over ,LOTR1,False
4757, far away answering horn were heard ,LOTR1,False
4758, the black figure fled from the house ,LOTR1,False
4759, one of them let fall a hobbit cloak on the step a he ran ,LOTR1,False
4760, in the lane the noise of hoof broke out and gathering to a gallop went hammering away into the darkn ,LOTR1,False
4761, all about crickhollow there wa the sound of horn blowing and voice crying and feet running ,LOTR1,False
4762, but the black rider rode like a gale to the north gate ,LOTR1,False
4763, let the little people blow ,LOTR1,False
4764, sauron would deal with them later ,LOTR1,False
4765, meanwhile they had another errand: they knew now that the house wa empty and the ring had gone ,LOTR1,False
4766, they rode down the guard at the gate and vanished from the shire ,LOTR1,False
4767, in the early night frodo woke from deep sleep suddenly a if some sound or presence had disturbed him ,LOTR1,False
4768, he saw that strider wa sitting alert in hi chair: hi eye gleamed in the light of the fire which had been tended and wa burning brightly; but he made no sign or movement ,LOTR1,False
4769, frodo soon went to sleep again; but hi dream were again troubled with the noise of wind and of galloping hoof ,LOTR1,False
4770, the wind seemed to be curling round the house and shaking it; and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly ,LOTR1,False
4771, he opened hi eye and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn yard ,LOTR1,False
4772, strider had drawn the curtain and pushed back the shutter with a clang ,LOTR1,False
4773, the first grey light of day wa in the room and a cold air wa coming through the open window ,LOTR1,False
4774, a soon a strider had roused them all he led the way to their bedroom when they saw them they were glad that they had taken hi advice: the window had been forced open and were swinging and the curtain were flapping; the bed were tossed about and the bolster slashed and flung upon the floor; the brown mat wa torn to piece ,LOTR1,False
4775, strider immediately went to fetch the landlord ,LOTR1,False
4776, poor mr butterbur looked sleepy and frightened ,LOTR1,False
4777, he had hardly closed hi eye all night (so he said) but he had never heard a sound ,LOTR1,False
4778, never ha such a thing happened in my time ,LOTR1,False
4779, he cried raising hi hand in horror ,LOTR1,False
4780, guest unable to sleep in their bed and good bolster ruined and all ,LOTR1,False
4781, what are we coming to ,LOTR1,False
4782, dark time  said strider ,LOTR1,False
4783, but for the present you may be left in peace when you have got rid of u ,LOTR1,False
4784, we will leave at once ,LOTR1,False
4785, never mind about breakfast: a drink and a bite standing will have to do ,LOTR1,False
4786, we shall be packed in a few minute ,LOTR1,False
4787, mr butterbur hurried off to see that their ponie were got ready and to fetch them a bite ,LOTR1,False
4788, but very soon he came back in dismay ,LOTR1,False
4789, the stable door had all been opened in the night and they were gone: not only merry ponie but every other horse and beast in the place ,LOTR1,False
4790, frodo wa crushed by the new ,LOTR1,False
4791, how could they hope to reach rivendell on foot pursued by mounted enemies ,LOTR1,False
4792, they might a well set out for the moon ,LOTR1,False
4793, strider sat silent for a while looking at the hobbit a if he wa weighing up their strength and courage ,LOTR1,False
4794, ponie would not help u to escape horsemen  he said at last thoughtfully a if he guessed what frodo had in mind ,LOTR1,False
4795, we should not go much slower on foot not on the road that i mean to take ,LOTR1,False
4796, i wa going to walk in any case ,LOTR1,False
4797, it i the food and store that trouble me ,LOTR1,False
4798, we cannot count on getting anything to eat between here and rivendell except what we take with us; and we ought to take plenty to spare; for we may be delayed or forced to go round about far out of the direct way ,LOTR1,False
4799, how much are you prepared to carry on your backs ,LOTR1,False
4800, a much a we must  said pippin with a sinking heart but trying to show that he wa tougher than he looked (or felt) ,LOTR1,False
4801, i can carry enough for two  said sam defiantly ,LOTR1,False
4802, cant anything be done mr butterbur ,LOTR1,False
4803, cant we get a couple of ponie in the village or even one just for the baggage ,LOTR1,False
4804, i dont suppose we could hire them but we might be able to buy them  he added doubtfully wondering if he could afford it ,LOTR1,False
4805, i doubt it  said the landlord unhappily ,LOTR1,False
4806, the two or three riding ponie that there were in bree were stabled in my yard and theyre gone ,LOTR1,False
4807, a for other animal horse or ponie for draught or what not there are very few of them in bree and they wont be for sale ,LOTR1,False
4808, but ill do what i can ,LOTR1,False
4809, ill rout out bob and send him round a soon a may be ,LOTR1,False
4810, ye  said strider reluctantly you had better do that ,LOTR1,False
4811, i am afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at least ,LOTR1,False
4812, but so end all hope of starting early and slipping away quietly ,LOTR1,False
4813, we might a well have blown a horn to announce our departure ,LOTR1,False
4814, that wa part of their plan no doubt ,LOTR1,False
4815, there i one crumb of comfort  said merry and more than a crumb i hope: we can have breakfast while we wait and sit down to it ,LOTR1,False
4816, let get hold of nob ,LOTR1,False
4817, in the end there wa more than three hours delay ,LOTR1,False
4818, bob came back with the report that no horse or pony wa to be got for love or money in the neighbourhood except one: bill ferny had one that he might possibly sell ,LOTR1,False
4819, a poor old half starved creature it i  said bob; but he wont part with it for l than thrice it worth seeing how youre placed not if i know bill ferny ,LOTR1,False
4820, wouldnt the beast bolt back to him with all our stuff or help in tracking u or something ,LOTR1,False
4821, i wonder  said strider ,LOTR1,False
4822, but i cannot imagine any animal running home to him once it got away ,LOTR1,False
4823, i fancy thi i only an afterthought of kind master fernys: just a way of increasing hi profit from the affair ,LOTR1,False
4824, the chief danger i that the poor beast i probably at death door ,LOTR1,False
4825, but there doe not seem any choice ,LOTR1,False
4826, what doe he want for it ,LOTR1,False
4827, bill ferny price wa twelve silver pennies; and that wa indeed at least three time the pony value in those pan ,LOTR1,False
4828, it proved to be a bony underfed and dispirited animal; but it did not look like dying just yet ,LOTR1,False
4829, mr butterbur paid for it himself and offered merry another eighteen pence a some compensation for the lost animal ,LOTR1,False
4830, he wa an honest man and well off a thing were reckoned in bree; but thirty silver pennie wa a sore blow to him and being cheated by bill ferny made it harder to bear ,LOTR1,False
4831, asa matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end ,LOTR1,False
4832, it turned out later that only one horse had been actually stolen ,LOTR1,False
4833, the other had been driven off or had bolted in terror and were found wandering in different corner of the bree land ,LOTR1,False
4834, merry ponie had escaped altogether and eventually (having a good deal of sense) they made their way to the down in search of fatty lumpkin ,LOTR1,False
4835, so they came under the care of tom bombadil for a while and were well off ,LOTR1,False
4836, but when new of the event at bree came to tom ear he sent them to mr butterbur who thu got five good beast at a very fair price ,LOTR1,False
4837, they had to work harder in bree but bob treated them well; so on the whole they were lucky: they missed a dark and dangerou journey ,LOTR1,False
4838, but they never came to rivendell ,LOTR1,False
4839, however in the meanwhile for all mr butterbur knew hi money wa gone for good or for bad ,LOTR1,False
4840, and he had other trouble ,LOTR1,False
4841, for there wa a great commotion a soon a the remaining guest were astir and heard new of the raid on the inn ,LOTR1,False
4842, the southern traveller had lost several horse and blamed the innkeeper loudly until it became known that one of their own number had also disappeared in the night none other than bill ferny squint eyed companion ,LOTR1,False
4843, suspicion fell on him at once ,LOTR1,False
4844, if you pick up with a horse thief and bring him to my house  said butterbur angrily you ought to pay for all the damage yourselve and not come shouting at me ,LOTR1,False
4845, go and ask ferny where your handsome friend is ,LOTR1,False
4846, but it appeared that he wa nobody friend and nobody could recollect when he had joined their party ,LOTR1,False
4847, after their breakfast the hobbit had to re pack and get together further supplie for the longer journey they were now expecting ,LOTR1,False
4848, it wa close on ten oclock before they at last got off ,LOTR1,False

4853, strider had changed hi mind and he decided to leave bree by the main road ,LOTR1,False
4854, any attempt to set off acros country at once would only make matter worse: half the inhabitant would follow them to see what they were up to and to prevent them from trespassing ,LOTR1,False

4859, not all the face were friendly nor all the word that were shouted ,LOTR1,False
4860, but strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the bree lander and those that he stared at shut their mouth and drew away ,LOTR1,False
4861, he walked in front with frodo; next came merry and pippin; and last came sam leading the pony which wa laden with a much of their baggage a they had the heart to give it; but already it looked l dejected a if it approved of the change in it fortune ,LOTR1,False

4866, the hobbit took no notice of the inquisitive head that peeped out of door or popped over wall and fence a they passed ,LOTR1,False
4867, but a they drew near to the further gate frodo saw a dark ill kept house behind a thick hedge: the last house in the village ,LOTR1,False
4868, in one of the window he caught a glimpse of a sallow face with sly slanting eyes; but it vanished at once ,LOTR1,False
4869, so that where that southerner i hiding ,LOTR1,False

4883, with a sudden flick quick a lightning an apple left hi hand and hit bill square on the nose ,LOTR1,False
4884, he ducked too late and curse came from behind the hedge ,LOTR1,False
4885, waste of a good apple  said sam regretfully and strode on ,LOTR1,False
4886, at last they left the village behind ,LOTR1,False
4887, the escort of children and straggler that had followed them got tired and turned back at the south gate ,LOTR1,False
4888, passing through they kept on along the road for some mile ,LOTR1,False
4889, it bent to the left curving back into it eastward line a it rounded the feet of bree hill and then it began to run swiftly downward into wooded country ,LOTR1,False
4890, to their left they could see some of the house and hobbit hole of staddle on the gentler south eastern slope of the hill; down in a deep hollow away north of the road there were wisp of rising smoke that showed where combe lay; archet wa hidden in the tree beyond ,LOTR1,False
4891, after the road had run down some way and had left bree hill standing tall and brown behind they came on a narrow track that led off toward the north ,LOTR1,False
4892, thi i where we leave the open and take to cover  said strider ,LOTR1,False
4893, not a short cut i hope  said pippin ,LOTR1,False

4895, ah but you had not got me with you then  laughed strider ,LOTR1,False
4896, my cut short or long dont go wrong ,LOTR1,False
4897, he took a look up and down the road ,LOTR1,False
4898, no one wa in sight; and he led the way quickly down toward the wooded valley ,LOTR1,False
4899, hi plan a far a they could understand it without knowing the country wa to go toward archet at first but to bear right and pas it on the east and then to steer a straight a he could over the wild land to weathertop hill ,LOTR1,False
4900, in that way they would if all went well cut off a great loop of the road which further on bent southward to avoid the midgewater marshe ,LOTR1,False
4901, but of course they would have to pas through the marshe themselve and strider description of them wa not encouraging ,LOTR1,False
4902, however in the meanwhile walking wa not unpleasant ,LOTR1,False
4903, indeed if it had not been for the disturbing event of the night before they would have enjoyed thi pan of the journey better than any up to that time ,LOTR1,False
4904, the sun wa shining clear but not too hot ,LOTR1,False
4905, the wood in the valley were still leafy and full of colour and seemed peaceful and wholesome ,LOTR1,False
4906, strider guided them confidently among the many crossing path although left to themselve they would soon have been at a los ,LOTR1,False
4907, he wa taking a wandering course with many turn and doubling to put off any pursuit ,LOTR1,False
4908, bill ferny will have watched where we left the road for certain  he said; though i dont think he will follow u himself ,LOTR1,False

4911, i dont suppose they are far away ,LOTR1,False
4912, if they think we have made for archet so much the better ,LOTR1,False
4913, whether because of strider skill or for some other reason they saw no sign and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day: neither two footed except birds; nor four footed except one fox and a few squirrel ,LOTR1,False
4914, the next day they began to steer a steady course eastwards; and still all wa quiet and peaceful ,LOTR1,False
4915, on the third day out from bree they came out of the chetwood ,LOTR1,False
4916, the land had been falling steadily ever since they turned aside from the road and they now entered a wide flat expanse of country much more difficult to manage ,LOTR1,False
4917, they were far beyond the border of the bree land out in the pathl wildern and drawing near to the midge water marshe ,LOTR1,False
4918, the ground now became damp and in place boggy and here and there they came upon pool and wide stretche of reed and rushe filled with the warbling of little hidden bird ,LOTR1,False
4919, they had to pick their way carefully to keep both dry footed and on their proper course ,LOTR1,False
4920, at first they made fan progr but a they went on their passage became slower and more dangerou ,LOTR1,False
4921, the marshe were bewildering and treacherou and there wa no permanent trail even for ranger to find through their shifting quagmire ,LOTR1,False
4922, the flie began to torment them and the air wa full of cloud of tiny midge that crept up their sleeve and breeche and into their hair ,LOTR1,False
4923, i am being eaten alive ,LOTR1,False
4924, there are more midge than water ,LOTR1,False
4925, what do they live on when they cant get hobbit ,LOTR1,False
4926, asked sam scratching hi neck ,LOTR1,False

4935, he said to strider who had risen and wa standing gazing ahead into the night ,LOTR1,False
4936, i do not know  strider answered ,LOTR1,False
4937, it i too distant to make out ,LOTR1,False
4938, it i like lightning that leap up from the hill top ,LOTR1,False
4939, frodo lay down again but for a long while he could still see the white flashe and against them the tall dark figure of strider standing silent and watchful ,LOTR1,False
4940, at last he passed into uneasy sleep ,LOTR1,False
4941, they had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last straggling pool and reed bed of the marshe behind them ,LOTR1,False
4942, the land before them began steadily to rise again ,LOTR1,False
4943, away in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hill ,LOTR1,False
4944, the highest of them wa at the right of the line and a little separated from the other ,LOTR1,False
4945, it had a conical top slightly flattened at the summit ,LOTR1,False
4946, that i weathertop  said strider ,LOTR1,False
4947, the old road which we have left far away on our right run to the south of it and passe not far from it foot ,LOTR1,False

4950, i mean: when we do get there it i not certain what we shall find ,LOTR1,False
4951, it i close to the road ,LOTR1,False
4952, but surely we were hoping to find gandalf there ,LOTR1,False
4953, yes; but the hope i faint ,LOTR1,False
4954, if he come thi way at all he may not pas through bree and so he may not know what we are doing ,LOTR1,False
4955, and anyway unl by luck we arrive almost together we shall mis one another; it will not be safe for him or for u to wait there long ,LOTR1,False
4956, if the rider fail to find u in the wildern they are likely to make for weathertop themselve ,LOTR1,False
4957, it command a wide view all round ,LOTR1,False
4958, indeed there are many bird and beast in thi country that could see u a we stand here from that hill top ,LOTR1,False
4959, not all the bird are to be trusted and there are other spie more evil than they are ,LOTR1,False
4960, the hobbit looked anxiously at the distant hill ,LOTR1,False
4961, sam looked up into the pale sky fearing to see hawk or eagle hovering over them with bright unfriendly eye ,LOTR1,False
4962, you do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome strider ,LOTR1,False
4963, what do you advise u to do ,LOTR1,False
4964, i think  answered strider slowly a if he wa not quite sure i think the best thing i to go a straight eastward from here a we can to make for the line of hill not for weathertop ,LOTR1,False
4965, there we can strike a path i know that run at their feet; it will bring u to weathertop from the north and l openly ,LOTR1,False
4966, then we shall see what we shall see ,LOTR1,False
4967, all that day they plodded along until the cold and early evening came down ,LOTR1,False
4968, the land became drier and more barren; but mist and vapour lay behind them on the marshe ,LOTR1,False
4969, a few melancholy bird were piping and wailing until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows; then an empty silence fell ,LOTR1,False
4970, the hobbit thought of the soft light of sunset glancing through the cheerful window of bag end far away ,LOTR1,False
4971, at the day end they came to a stream that wandered down from the hill to lose itself in the stagnant marshland and they went up along it bank while the light lasted ,LOTR1,False
4972, it wa already night when at last they halted and made their camp under some stunted alder tree by the shore of the stream ,LOTR1,False
4973, ahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak and treel back of the hill ,LOTR1,False
4974, that night they set a watch and strider it seemed did not sleep at all ,LOTR1,False
4975, the moon wa waxing and in the early night hour a cold grey light lay on the land ,LOTR1,False
4976, next morning they set out again soon after sunrise ,LOTR1,False
4977, there wa a frost in the air and the sky wa a pale clear blue ,LOTR1,False
4978, the hobbit felt refreshed a if they had had a night of unbroken sleep ,LOTR1,False
4979, already they were getting used to much walking on short common shorter at any rate than what in the shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their leg ,LOTR1,False
4980, pippin declared that frodo wa looking twice the hobbit that he had been ,LOTR1,False
4981, very odd  said frodo tightening hi belt considering that there i actually a good deal l of me ,LOTR1,False
4982, i hope the thinning proc will not go on indefinitely or i shall become a wraith ,LOTR1,False
4983, do not speak of such things ,LOTR1,False
4984, said strider quickly and with surprising earnestn ,LOTR1,False
4985, they made an undulating ridge often rising almost to a thousand feet and here and there falling again to low cleft or passe leading into the eastern land beyond ,LOTR1,False
4986, along the crest of the ridge the hobbit could see what looked to be the remain of green grown wall and dike and in the cleft there still stood the ruin of old work of stone ,LOTR1,False
4987, by night they had reached the feet of the westward slope and there they camped ,LOTR1,False
4988, it wa the night of the fifth of october and they were six day out from bree ,LOTR1,False
4989, in the morning they found for the first time since they had left the chetwood a track plain to see ,LOTR1,False
4990, they turned right and followed it southward ,LOTR1,False
4991, it ran cunningly taking a line that seemed chosen so a to keep a much hidden a possible from the view both of the hill top above and of the flat to the west ,LOTR1,False
4992, it dived into dell and hugged steep banks; and where it passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there were line of large boulder and hewn stone that screened the traveller almost like a hedge ,LOTR1,False
4993, i wonder who made thi path and what for  said merry a they walked along one of these avenue where the stone were unusually large and closely set ,LOTR1,False
4994, i am not sure that i like it: it ha a well rather a barrow wightish look ,LOTR1,False
4995, i there any barrow on weathertop ,LOTR1,False
4996, there i no barrow on weathertop nor on any of these hill  answered strider ,LOTR1,False
4997, the men of the west did not live here; though in their latter day they defended the hill for a while against the evil that came out of angmar ,LOTR1,False
4998, thi path wa made to serve the fort along the wall ,LOTR1,False
4999, but long before in the first day of the north kingdom they built a great watch tower on weathertop amon syl they called it ,LOTR1,False
5000, it wa burned and broken and nothing remain of it now but a tumbled ring like a rough crown on the old hill head ,LOTR1,False
5001, yet once it wa tall and fair ,LOTR1,False
5002, it i told that elendil stood there watching for the coming of gil galad out of the west in the day of the last alliance ,LOTR1,False
5003, the hobbit gazed at strider ,LOTR1,False
5004, it seemed that he wa learned in old lore a well a in the way of the wild ,LOTR1,False
5005, asked merry; but strider did not answer and seemed to be lost in thought ,LOTR1,False
5006, suddenly a low voice murmured: gil galad wa an elven king ,LOTR1,False
5007, of him the harper sadly sing: the last whose realm wa fair and free between the mountain and the sea ,LOTR1,False
5008, hi sword wa long hi lance wa keen hi shining helm afar wa seen; the countl star of heaven field were mirrored in hi silver shield ,LOTR1,False
5009, but long ago he rode away and where he dwelleth none can say; for into darkn fell hi star in mordor where the shadow are ,LOTR1,False
5010, the other turned in amazement for the voice wa sam ,LOTR1,False
5011, that all i know  stammered sam blushing ,LOTR1,False

5021, i didnt learn that part it gave me the shiver i never thought i should be going that way myself ,LOTR1,False
5022, i hope it wont come to that ,LOTR1,False
5023, do not speak that name so loudly ,LOTR1,False
5024, it wa already mid day when they drew near the southern end of the path and saw before them in the pale clear light of the october sun a grey green bank leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the hill they decided to make for the top at once while the daylight wa broad concealment wa no longer possible and they could only hope that no enemy or spy wa observing them ,LOTR1,False
5025, nothing wa to be seen moving on the hill ,LOTR1,False
5026, if gandalf wa anywhere about there wa no sign of him ,LOTR1,False
5027, on the western flank of weathertop they found a sheltered hollow at the bottom of which there wa a bowl shaped dell with grassy side ,LOTR1,False
5028, there they left sam and pippin with the pony and their pack and luggage ,LOTR1,False
5029, the other three went on ,LOTR1,False
5030, after half an hour plodding climb strider reached the crown of the hill; frodo and merry followed tired and breathl ,LOTR1,False
5031, the last slope had been steep and rocky ,LOTR1,False
5032, on the top they found a strider had said a wide ring of ancient stonework now crumbling or covered with age long gras ,LOTR1,False
5033, but in the centre a cairn of broken stone had been piled ,LOTR1,False
5034, they were blackened a if with fire ,LOTR1,False
5035, about them the turf wa burned to the root and all within the ring the gras wa scorched and shrivelled a if flame had swept the hill top; but there wa no sign of any living thing ,LOTR1,False
5036, standing upon the rim of the ruined circle they saw all round below them a wide prospect for the most pan of land empty and featurel except for patche of woodland away to the south beyond which they caught here and there the glint of distant water ,LOTR1,False
5037, beneath them on thi southern side there ran like a ribbon the old road coming out of the west and winding up and down until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east ,LOTR1,False
5038, nothing wa moving on it ,LOTR1,False
5039, following it line eastward with their eye they saw the mountains: the nearer foothill were brown and sombre; behind them stood taller shape of grey and behind those again were high white peak glimmering among the cloud ,LOTR1,False
5040, and very cheerl and uninviting it looks ,LOTR1,False
5041, there i no water and no shelter ,LOTR1,False
5042, and no sign of gandalf ,LOTR1,False
5043, but i dont blame him for not waiting if he ever came here ,LOTR1,False
5044, i wonder  said strider looking round thoughtfully ,LOTR1,False
5045, even if he wa a day or two behind u at bree he could have arrived here first ,LOTR1,False
5046, he can ride very swiftly when need presse ,LOTR1,False
5047, suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone on the top of the cairn; it wa flatter than the other and whiter a if it had escaped the fire ,LOTR1,False
5048, he picked it up and examined it turning it in hi finger ,LOTR1,False
5049, thi ha been handled recently  he said ,LOTR1,False
5050, what do you think of these marks ,LOTR1,False
5051, on the flat under side frodo saw some scratches: there seem to he a stroke a dot and three more stroke  he said ,LOTR1,False
5052, the stroke on the left might be a g rune with thin branche  said strider ,LOTR1,False
5053, it might be a sign left by gandalf though one cannot be sure ,LOTR1,False
5054, the scratche are fine and they certainly look fresh ,LOTR1,False
5055, but the mark might mean something quite different and have nothing to do with u ,LOTR1,False
5056, ranger use rune and they come here sometime ,LOTR1,False
5057, what could they mean even if gandalf made them ,LOTR1,False
5058, asked merry i should say  answered strider that they stood for gnumber and were a sign that gandalf wa here on october the third: that i three day ago now ,LOTR1,False
5059, it would also show that he wa in a hurry and danger wa at hand so that he had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer ,LOTR1,False
5060, if that i so we must be wary ,LOTR1,False
5061, i wish we could feel sure that he made the mark whatever they may mean  said frodo it would be a great comfort to know that he wa on the way in front of u or behind u ,LOTR1,False

5065, he i here no longer and we must now look after ourselve and make our own way to rivendell a best we can  how far i rivendell ,LOTR1,False
5066, asked merry gazing round wearily ,LOTR1,False
5067, the world looked wild and wide from weathertop ,LOTR1,False
5068, i dont know if the road ha ever been measured in mile beyond the forsaken inn a day journey east of bree  answered strider ,LOTR1,False
5069, some say it i so far and some say otherwise ,LOTR1,False
5070, it i a strange road and folk are glad to reach their journey end whether the time i long or short ,LOTR1,False
5071, but i know how long it would take me on my own feet with fair weather and no ill fortune twelve day from here to the ford of bruinen where the road crosse the loudwater that run out of rivendell ,LOTR1,False
5072, we have at least a fortnight journey before u for i do not think we shall be able to use the road ,LOTR1,False
5073, a lot may happen in that time ,LOTR1,False
5074, it may  said strider ,LOTR1,False
5075, they stood for a while silent on the hill top near it southward edge ,LOTR1,False
5076, in that lonely place frodo for the first time fully realized hi homelessn and danger ,LOTR1,False
5077, he wished bitterly that hi fortune had left him in the quiet and beloved shire ,LOTR1,False
5078, he stared down at the hateful road leading back westward to hi home ,LOTR1,False
5079, suddenly he wa aware that two black speck were moving slowly along it going westward; and looking again he saw that three other were creeping eastward to meet them ,LOTR1,False
5080, he gave a cry and clutched strider arm ,LOTR1,False
5081, look  he said pointing downward ,LOTR1,False
5082, at once strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle pulling frodo down beside him ,LOTR1,False
5083, i do not know but i fear the worst  answered strider ,LOTR1,False
5084, slowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring again and peered through a cleft between two jagged stone ,LOTR1,False
5085, the light wa no longer bright for the clear morning had faded and cloud creeping out of the east had now overtaken the sun a it began to go down ,LOTR1,False
5086, they could all see the black speck but neither frodo nor merry could make out their shape for certain; yet something told them that there far below were black rider assembling on the road beyond the foot of the hill ,LOTR1,False
5087, ye  said strider whose keener sight left him in no doubt ,LOTR1,False
5088, hastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to find their companion ,LOTR1,False
5089, sam and peregrin had not been idle ,LOTR1,False
5090, they had explored the small dell and the surrounding slope ,LOTR1,False
5091, not far away they found a spring of clear water in the hillside and near it footprint not more than a day or two old ,LOTR1,False
5092, in the dell itself they found recent trace of a fire and other sign of a hasty camp ,LOTR1,False
5093, there were some fallen rock on the edge of the dell nearest to the hill ,LOTR1,False

5105, he paused and stood in anxiou thought ,LOTR1,False
5106, each of the hobbit saw in hi mind a vision of the cloaked and booted rider ,LOTR1,False
5107, if the horsemen had already found the dell the sooner strider led them somewhere else the better ,LOTR1,False
5108, sam viewed the hollow with great dislike now that he had heard new of their enemie on the road only a few mile away ,LOTR1,False

5120, i wa too carel on the hill top  answered strider ,LOTR1,False
5121, i wa very anxiou to find some sign of gandalf; but it wa a mistake for three of u to go up and stand there so long ,LOTR1,False
5122, for the black horse can see and the rider can use men and other creature a spie a we found at bree ,LOTR1,False
5123, they themselve do not see the world of light a we do but our shape cast shadow in their mind which only the noon sun destroys; and in the dark they perceive many sign and form that are hidden from us: then they are most to be feared ,LOTR1,False
5124, and at all time they smell the blood of living thing desiring and hating it ,LOTR1,False

5145, only on the road would traveller be found most often dwarve hurrying along on busin of their own and with no help and few word to spare for stranger ,LOTR1,False
5146, i dont see how our food can be made to last  said frodo ,LOTR1,False

5148, there i food in the wild  said strider; berry root and herb; and i have some skill a a hunter at need ,LOTR1,False
5149, you need not be afraid of starving before winter come ,LOTR1,False
5150, but gathering and catching food i long and weary work and we need haste ,LOTR1,False
5151, so tighten your belt and think with hope of the table of elrond house ,LOTR1,False
5152, the cold increased a darkn came on ,LOTR1,False
5153, peering out from the edge of the dell they could see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into shadow ,LOTR1,False
5154, the sky above had cleared again and wa slowly filled with twinkling star ,LOTR1,False
5155, frodo and hi companion huddled round the fire wrapped in every garment and blanket they possessed; but strider wa content with a single cloak and sat a little apart drawing thoughtfully at hi pipe ,LOTR1,False

5166, with elendil the elf friend he went to the land of  no ,LOTR1,False
5167, said strider interrupting i do not think that tale should be told now with the servant of the enemy at hand ,LOTR1,False
5168, if we win through to the house of elrond you may hear it there told in full ,LOTR1,False
5169, then tell u some other tale of the old day  begged sam; a tale about the elve before the fading time ,LOTR1,False
5170, i would dearly like to hear more about elves; the dark seem to pr round so close ,LOTR1,False

5179, he heard there oft the flying sound of feet a light a linden leave or music welling underground in hidden hollow quavering ,LOTR1,False
5180, now withered lay the hemlock sheave and one by one with sighing sound whispering fell the beechen leave in the wintry woodland wavering ,LOTR1,False
5181, he sought her ever wandering far where leave of year were thickly strewn by light of moon and ray of star in frosty heaven shivering ,LOTR1,False
5182, her mantle glinted in the moon a on a hill top high and far she danced and at her feet wa strewn a mist of silver quivering ,LOTR1,False
5183, when winter passed she came again and her song released the sudden spring like rising lark and falling rain and melting water bubbling ,LOTR1,False
5184, he saw the elven flower spring about her feet and healed again he longed by her to dance and sing upon the gras untroubling ,LOTR1,False
5185, again she fled but swift he came ,LOTR1,False
5186, he called her by her elvish name; and there she halted listening ,LOTR1,False
5187, one moment stood she and a spell hi voice laid on her: beren came and doom fell on tinviel that in hi arm lay glistening ,LOTR1,False
5188, a beren looked into her eye within the shadow of her hair the trembling starlight of the skie he saw there mirrored shimmering ,LOTR1,False
5189, tinviel the elven fair immortal maiden elven wise about him cast her shadowy hair and arm like silver glimmering ,LOTR1,False

5191, the sundering sea between them lay and yet at last they met once more and long ago they passed away in the forest singing sorrowl ,LOTR1,False
5192, strider sighed and paused before he spoke again ,LOTR1,False
5193, that i a song  he said in the mode that i called ann thennath among the elve but i hard to render in our common speech and thi i but a rough echo of it ,LOTR1,False

5195, beren wa a mortal man but lthien wa the daughter of thingol a king of elve upon middle earth when the world wa young; and she wa the fairest maiden that ha ever been among all the children of thi world ,LOTR1,False
5196, a the star above the mist of the northern land wa her lovelin and in her face wa a shining light ,LOTR1,False
5197, in those day the great enemy of whom sauron of mordor wa but a servant dwelt in angband in the north and the elve of the west coming back to middle earth made war upon him to regain the silmaril which he had stolen; and the father of men aided the elve ,LOTR1,False
5198, but the enemy wa victoriou and barahir wa slain and beren escaping through great peril came over the mountain of terror into the hidden kingdom of thingol in the forest of neldoreth ,LOTR1,False
5199, there he beheld lthien singing and dancing in a glade beside the enchanted river esgalduin; and he named her tinviel that i nightingale in the language of old ,LOTR1,False
5200, many sorrow befell them afterward and they were parted long ,LOTR1,False
5201, tinviel rescued beren from the dungeon of sauron and together they passed through great danger and cast down even the great enemy from hi throne and took from hi iron crown one of the three silmaril brightest of all jewel to be the bride price of lthien to thingol her father ,LOTR1,False
5202, yet at the last beren wa slain by the wolf that came from the gate of angband and he died in the arm of tinviel ,LOTR1,False
5203, but she chose mortality and to die from the world so that she might follow him; and it i sung that they met again beyond the sundering sea and after a brief time walking alive once more in the green wood together they passed long ago beyond the confine of thi world ,LOTR1,False
5204, so it i that lthien tinviel alone of the elf kindred ha died indeed and left the world and they have lost her whom they most loved ,LOTR1,False
5205, but from her the lineage of the elf lord of old descended among men ,LOTR1,False
5206, there live still those of whom lthien wa the foremother and it i said that her line shall never fail ,LOTR1,False
5207, elrond of rivendell i of that kin ,LOTR1,False

5211, hi eye shone and hi voice wa rich and deep ,LOTR1,False
5212, above him wa a black starry sky ,LOTR1,False
5213, suddenly a pale light appeared over the crown of weathertop behind him ,LOTR1,False
5214, the waxing moon wa climbing slowly above the hill that overshadowed them and the star above the hill top faded ,LOTR1,False
5215, the hobbit moved and stretched ,LOTR1,False
5216, the moon i rising: it must be getting late ,LOTR1,False
5217, even a they did so they saw on the top of the hill something small and dark against the glimmer of the moonrise ,LOTR1,False
5218, it wa perhap only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale light ,LOTR1,False
5219, sam and merry got up and walked away from the fire ,LOTR1,False
5220, frodo and pippin remained seated in silence ,LOTR1,False
5221, strider wa watching the moonlight on the hill intently ,LOTR1,False
5222, all seemed quiet and still but frodo felt a cold dread creeping over hi heart now that strider wa no longer speaking ,LOTR1,False
5223, he huddled closer to the fire ,LOTR1,False
5224, at that moment sam came running back from the edge of the dell ,LOTR1,False
5225, i dont know what it i  he said but i suddenly felt afraid ,LOTR1,False
5226, i durstnt go outside thi dell for any money; i felt that something wa creeping up the slope ,LOTR1,False
5227, asked frodo springing to hi feet ,LOTR1,False
5228, i saw nothing but i didnt stop to look ,LOTR1,False
5229, i saw something  said merry; or i thought i did away westward where the moonlight wa falling on the flat beyond the shadow of the hill top i thought there were two or three black shape ,LOTR1,False
5230, they seemed to be moving thi way ,LOTR1,False
5231, keep close to the fire with your face outward ,LOTR1,False
5232, get some of the longer stick ready in your hands ,LOTR1,False
5233, for a breathl time they sat there silent and alert with their back turned to the wood fire each gazing into the shadow that encircled them ,LOTR1,False
5234, there wa no sound or movement in the night ,LOTR1,False
5235, frodo stirred feeling that he must break the silence: he longed to shout out aloud ,LOTR1,False
5236, gasped pippin at the same moment ,LOTR1,False
5237, over the lip of the little dell on the side away from the hill they felt rather than saw a shadow rise one shadow or more than one ,LOTR1,False
5238, they strained their eye and the shadow seemed to grow ,LOTR1,False
5239, soon there could be no doubt: three or four tall black figure were standing there on the slope looking down on them ,LOTR1,False
5240, so black were they that they seemed like black hole in the deep shade behind them ,LOTR1,False
5241, frodo thought that he heard a faint his a of venomou breath and felt a thin piercing chill ,LOTR1,False
5242, then the shape slowly advanced ,LOTR1,False
5243, terror overcame pippin and merry and they threw themselve flat on the ground ,LOTR1,False
5244, sam shrank to frodo side ,LOTR1,False
5245, frodo wa hardly l terrified than hi companions; he wa quaking a if he wa bitter cold but hi terror wa swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the ring ,LOTR1,False
5246, the desire to do thi laid hold of him and he could think of nothing else ,LOTR1,False
5247, fie did not forget the barrow nor the message of gandalf; but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warning and he longed to yield ,LOTR1,False
5248, not with the hope of escape or of doing anything either good or bad: he simply felt that he must take the ring and put it on hi finger ,LOTR1,False
5249, fie felt sam looking at him a if he knew that hi master wa in some great trouble but he could not turn toward him ,LOTR1,False
5250, he shut hi eye and struggled for a while; but resistance became unbearable and at last he slowly drew out the chain and slipped the ring on the forefinger of hi left hand ,LOTR1,False
5251, immediately though everything else remained a before dim and dark the shape became terribly clear ,LOTR1,False
5252, he wa able to see beneath their black wrapping ,LOTR1,False
5253, there were five tall figures: two standing on the lip of the dell three advancing ,LOTR1,False
5254, in their white face burned keen and mercil eyes; under their mantle were long grey robes; upon their grey hair were helm of silver; in their haggard hand were sword of steel ,LOTR1,False
5255, their eye fell on him and pierced him a they rushed toward him ,LOTR1,False
5256, desperate he drew hi own sword and it seemed to him that it flickered red a if it wa a firebrand ,LOTR1,False
5257, two of the figure halted ,LOTR1,False
5258, the third wa taller than the others: hi hair wa long and gleaming and on hi helm wa a crown ,LOTR1,False
5259, in one hand he held a long sword and in the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale light ,LOTR1,False
5260, he sprang forward and bore down on frodo ,LOTR1,False
5261, at that moment frodo threw himself forward on the ground and he heard himself crying aloud: o elbereth ,LOTR1,False
5262, at the same time he struck at the feet of hi enemy ,LOTR1,False
5263, a shrill cry rang out in the night; and he felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce hi left shoulder ,LOTR1,False
5264, even a he swooned he caught a through a swirling mist a glimpse of strider leaping out of the darkn with a flaming brand of wood in either hand ,LOTR1,False
5265, with a last effort frodo dropping hi sword slipped the ring from hi finger and closed hi right hand tight upon it ,LOTR1,False
5266, flight to the ford when frodo came to himself he wa still clutching the ring desperately ,LOTR1,False
5267, he wa lying by the fire which wa now piled high and burning brightly ,LOTR1,False
5268, hi three companion were bending over him ,LOTR1,False
5269, where i the pale king ,LOTR1,False
5270, they were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer for a while; nor did they understand hi question ,LOTR1,False
5271, at length he gathered from sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shape coming toward them ,LOTR1,False
5272, suddenly to hi horror sam found that hi master had vanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him and he fell ,LOTR1,False
5273, he heard frodo voice but it seemed to come from a great distance or from under the earth crying out strange word ,LOTR1,False
5274, they saw nothing more until they stumbled over the body of frodo lying a if dead face downward on the gras with hi sword beneath him ,LOTR1,False
5275, strider ordered them to pick him up and lay him near the fire and then he disappeared ,LOTR1,False
5276, that wa now a good while ago ,LOTR1,False
5277, sam plainly wa beginning to have doubt again about strider; but while they were talking he returned appearing suddenly out of the shadow ,LOTR1,False
5278, they started and sam drew hi sword and stood over frodo; but strider knelt down swiftly at hi side ,LOTR1,False
5279, i am not a black rider sam  he said gently nor in league with them ,LOTR1,False
5280, i have been trying to discover something of their movements; but i have found nothing ,LOTR1,False
5281, i cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again ,LOTR1,False
5282, but there i no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand ,LOTR1,False
5283, when he heard what frodo had to tell he became full of concern and shook hi head and sighed ,LOTR1,False
5284, then he ordered pippin and merry to heat a much water a they could in their small kettle and to bathe the wound with it ,LOTR1,False
5285, keep the fire going well and keep frodo warm ,LOTR1,False
5286, then he got up and walked away and called sam to him ,LOTR1,False
5287, i think i understand thing better now  he said in a low voice ,LOTR1,False
5288, there seem only to have been five of the enemy ,LOTR1,False
5289, why they were not all here i dont know; but i dont think they expected to be resisted ,LOTR1,False
5290, they have drawn off for the time being ,LOTR1,False
5291, but not far i fear ,LOTR1,False
5292, they will come again another night if we cannot escape ,LOTR1,False
5293, they are only waiting because they think that their purpose i almost accomplished and that the ring cannot fly much further ,LOTR1,False
5294, i fear sam that they believe your master ha a deadly wound that will subdue him to their will ,LOTR1,False
5295, you must trust me now ,LOTR1,False
5296, your frodo i made of sterner stuff than i had guessed though gandalf hinted that it might prove so ,LOTR1,False
5297, he i not slain and i think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than hi enemie expect ,LOTR1,False
5298, i will do all i can to help and heal him ,LOTR1,False
5299, guard him well while i am away ,LOTR1,False
5300, he hurried off and disappeared again into the darkn ,LOTR1,False
5301, frodo dozed though the pain of hi wound wa slowly growing and a deadly chill wa spreading from hi shoulder to hi arm and side ,LOTR1,False
5302, hi friend watched over him warming him and bathing hi wound ,LOTR1,False
5303, the night passed slowly and wearily ,LOTR1,False
5304, dawn wa growing in the sky and the dell wa filling with grey light when strider at last returned ,LOTR1,False
5305, he cried; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that had lain there hidden by the darkn ,LOTR1,False
5306, a foot above the lower hem there wa a slash ,LOTR1,False
5307, thi wa the stroke of frodo sword  he said ,LOTR1,False
5308, the only hurt that it did to hi enemy i fear; for it i unharmed but all blade perish that pierce that dreadful king ,LOTR1,False
5309, more deadly to him wa the name of elbereth ,LOTR1,False
5310, and more deadly to frodo wa this ,LOTR1,False
5311, he stooped again and lifted up a long thin knife ,LOTR1,False
5312, there wa a cold gleam in it ,LOTR1,False
5313, a strider raised it they saw that near the end it edge wa notched and the point wa broken off ,LOTR1,False
5314, but even a he held it up in the growing light they gazed in astonishment for the blade seemed to melt and vanished like a smoke in the air leaving only the hilt in strider hand ,LOTR1,False
5315, it wa thi accursed knife that gave the wound ,LOTR1,False
5316, few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapon ,LOTR1,False
5317, but i will do what i can ,LOTR1,False
5318, he sat down on the ground and taking the dagger hilt laid it on hi knee and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue ,LOTR1,False
5319, then setting it aside he turned to frodo and in a soft tone spoke word the other could not catch ,LOTR1,False
5320, from the pouch at hi belt he drew out the long leave of a plant ,LOTR1,False
5321, these leave  he said i have walked far to find; for thi plant doe not grow in the bare hills; but in the thicket away south of the road i found it in the dark by the scent of it leave ,LOTR1,False
5322, he crushed a leaf in hi finger and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance ,LOTR1,False
5323, it i fortunate that i could find it for it i a healing plant that the men of the west brought to middle earth ,LOTR1,False
5324, athela they named it and it grow now sparsely and only near place where they dwelt or camped of old; and it i not known in the north except to some of those who wander in the wild ,LOTR1,False
5325, it ha great virtue but over such a wound a thi it healing power may be small ,LOTR1,False
5326, he threw the leave into boiling water and bathed frodo shoulder ,LOTR1,False
5327, the fragrance of the steam wa refreshing and those that were unhurt felt their mind calmed and cleared ,LOTR1,False
5328, the herb had also some power over the wound for frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in hi side; but the life did not return to hi arm and he could not raise or use hi hand ,LOTR1,False
5329, he bitterly regretted hi foolishn and reproached himself for weakn of will; for he now perceived that in putting on the ring he obeyed not hi own desire but the commanding wish of hi enemie ,LOTR1,False
5330, he wondered if he would remain maimed for life and how they would now manage to continue their journey ,LOTR1,False
5331, he fell too weak to stand ,LOTR1,False
5332, the other were discussing thi very question ,LOTR1,False
5333, they quickly decided to leave weathertop a soon a possible ,LOTR1,False
5334, i think now  said strider that the enemy ha been watching thi place for some day ,LOTR1,False
5335, if gandalf ever came here then he must have been forced to ride away and he will not return ,LOTR1,False
5336, in any case we are in great peril here after dark since the attack of last night and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go ,LOTR1,False
5337, a soon a the daylight wa full they had some hurried food and packed ,LOTR1,False
5338, it wa impossible for frodo to walk so they divided the greater part of their baggage among the four of them and put frodo on the pony ,LOTR1,False
5339, in the last few day the poor beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed fatter and stronger and had begun to show an affection for it new master especially for sam ,LOTR1,False
5340, bill ferny treatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem so much better than it former life ,LOTR1,False
5341, they started off in a southerly direction ,LOTR1,False
5342, thi would mean crossing the road but ,LOTR1,False
5343, it wa the quickest way to more wooded country ,LOTR1,False
5344, and they needed fuel; for strider said that frodo must be kept warm especially at night while fire would be some protection for them all ,LOTR1,False
5345, it wa also hi plan to shorten their journey by cutting acros another great loop of the road: east beyond weathertop it changed it course and took a wide bend northward ,LOTR1,False
5346, they made their way slowly and cautiously round the south western slope of the hill and came in a little while to the edge of the road ,LOTR1,False
5347, there wa no sign of the rider ,LOTR1,False
5348, but even a they were hurrying acros they heard far away two cries: a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering ,LOTR1,False
5349, trembling they sprang forward and made for the thicket that lay ahead ,LOTR1,False
5350, the land before them sloped away southward but it wa wild and pathless; bushe and stunted tree grew in dense patche with wide barren space in between ,LOTR1,False
5351, the gras wa scanty coarse and grey; and the leave in the thicket were faded and falling ,LOTR1,False
5352, it wa a cheerl land and their journey wa slow and gloomy ,LOTR1,False

5356, before the first day march wa over frodo pain began to grow again but he did not speak of it for a long time ,LOTR1,False
5357, four day passed without the ground or the scene changing much except that behind them weathertop slowly sank and before them the distant mountain loomed a little nearer ,LOTR1,False
5358, yet since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked their flight or followed them ,LOTR1,False
5359, they dreaded the dark hour and kept watch in pair by night expecting at any time to see black shape stalking in the grey night dimly lit by the cloud veiled moon; but they saw nothing and heard no sound but the sigh of withered leave and gras ,LOTR1,False
5360, not once did they feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in the dell ,LOTR1,False
5361, it seemed too much to hope that the rider had already lost their trail again ,LOTR1,False
5362, perhap they were waiting to make some ambush in a narrow place ,LOTR1,False
5363, at the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended ,LOTR1,False
5364, strider now turned their course again north eastward and on the sixth day they reached the top of a long slow climbing slope and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hill ,LOTR1,False
5365, away below them they could see the road sweeping round the feet of the hills; and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine ,LOTR1,False
5366, in the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley half veiled in mist ,LOTR1,False
5367, i am afraid we must go back to the road here for a while  said strider ,LOTR1,False

5377, one river at a time ,LOTR1,False
5378, we shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the last bridge held against u ,LOTR1,False
5379, next day early in the morning they came down again to the border of the road ,LOTR1,False
5380, sam and strider went forward but they found no sign of any traveller or rider ,LOTR1,False
5381, here under the shadow of the hill there had been some rain ,LOTR1,False
5382, strider judged that it had fallen two day before and had washed away all footprint ,LOTR1,False
5383, no horseman had passed since then a far a he could see ,LOTR1,False
5384, they hurried along with all the speed they could make and after a mile or two they saw the last bridge ahead at the bottom of a short steep slope ,LOTR1,False
5385, they dreaded to see black figure waiting there but they saw none ,LOTR1,False
5386, strider made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the road while he went forward to explore ,LOTR1,False
5387, before long he came hurrying back ,LOTR1,False
5388, i can see no sign of the enemy  he said and i wonder very much what that mean ,LOTR1,False
5389, but i have found something very strange ,LOTR1,False
5390, he held out hi hand and showed a single pale green jewel ,LOTR1,False
5391, i found it in the mud in the middle of the bridge  he said ,LOTR1,False
5392, it i a beryl an elf stone ,LOTR1,False
5393, whether it wa set there or let fall by chance i cannot say; but it bring hope to me ,LOTR1,False
5394, i will take it a a sign that we may pas the bridge; but beyond that i dare not keep to the road without some clearer token ,LOTR1,False
5395, at once they went on again ,LOTR1,False
5396, they crossed the bridge in safety hearing no sound but the water swirling against it three great arche ,LOTR1,False
5397, a mile further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northward through the steep land on the left of the road ,LOTR1,False
5398, here strider turned aside and soon they were lost in a sombre country of dark tree winding among the feet of sullen hill ,LOTR1,False
5399, the hobbit were glad to leave the cheerl land and the perilou road behind them; but thi new country seemed threatening and unfriendly ,LOTR1,False
5400, a they went forward the hill about them steadily rose ,LOTR1,False
5401, here and there upon height and ridge they caught glimpse of ancient wall of stone and the ruin of towers: they had an ominou look ,LOTR1,False
5402, frodo who wa not walking had time to gaze ahead and to think ,LOTR1,False
5403, he recalled bilbo account of hi journey and the threatening tower on the hill north of the road in the country near the troll wood where hi first seriou adventure had happened ,LOTR1,False
5404, frodo guessed that they were now in the same region and wondered if by chance they would pas near the spot ,LOTR1,False

5410, but all were destroyed in the war that brought the north kingdom to it end ,LOTR1,False
5411, but that i now so long ago that the hill have forgotten them though a shadow still lie on the land ,LOTR1,False
5412, where did you learn such tale if all the land i empty and forgetful ,LOTR1,False
5413, the bird and beast do not tell tale of that son ,LOTR1,False

5416, i have  said strider ,LOTR1,False
5417, i dwelt there once and still i return when i may ,LOTR1,False
5418, there my heart is; but it i not my fate to sit in peace even in the fair house of elrond ,LOTR1,False
5419, the hill now began to shut them in ,LOTR1,False
5420, the road behind held on it way to the river bruinen but both were now hidden from view ,LOTR1,False
5421, the traveller came into a long valley; narrow deeply cloven dark and silent ,LOTR1,False
5422, tree with old and twisted root hung over cliff and piled up behind into mounting slope of pine wood ,LOTR1,False
5423, the hobbit grew very weary ,LOTR1,False
5424, they advanced slowly for they had to pick their way through a pathl country encumbered by fallen tree and tumbled rock ,LOTR1,False
5425, a long a they could they avoided climbing for frodo sake and because it wa in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dale ,LOTR1,False
5426, they had been two day in thi country when the weather turned wet ,LOTR1,False
5427, the wind began to blow steadily out of the west and pour the water of the distant sea on the dark head of the hill in fine drenching rain ,LOTR1,False
5428, by nightfall they were all soaked and their camp wa cheerl for they could not get any fire to burn ,LOTR1,False
5429, the next day the hill rose still higher and steeper before them and they were forced to turn away northward out of their course ,LOTR1,False
5430, strider seemed to be getting anxious: they were nearly ten day out from weathertop and their stock of provision wa beginning to run low ,LOTR1,False
5431, that night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock wall behind them in which there wa a shallow cave a mere scoop in the cliff ,LOTR1,False
5432, the cold and wet had made hi wound more painful than ever and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep ,LOTR1,False
5433, he lay tossing and turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night noises: wind in chink of rock water dripping a crack the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone ,LOTR1,False
5434, he felt that black shape were advancing to smother him; but when he sat up he saw nothing but the back of strider sitting hunched up smoking hi pipe and watching ,LOTR1,False
5435, he lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream in which he walked on the gras in hi garden in the shire but it seemed faint and dim l clear than the tall black shadow that stood looking over the hedge ,LOTR1,False
5436, in the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped ,LOTR1,False

5438, the wind wa shifting again ,LOTR1,False
5439, they did not start early ,LOTR1,False
5440, immediately after their cold and comfortl breakfast strider went off alone telling the other to remain under the shelter of the cliff until he came back ,LOTR1,False
5441, he wa going to climb up if he could and get a look at the lie of the land ,LOTR1,False
5442, when he returned he wa not reassuring ,LOTR1,False
5443, we have come too far to the north  he said and we must find some way to turn back southward again ,LOTR1,False
5444, if we keep on a we are going we shall get up into the ettendale far north of rivendell ,LOTR1,False
5445, that i troll country and little known to me ,LOTR1,False
5446, we could perhap find our way through and come round to rivendell from the north; but it would take too long for i do not know the way and our food would not last ,LOTR1,False
5447, so somehow or other we must find the ford of bruinen ,LOTR1,False
5448, the rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground ,LOTR1,False
5449, they found a passage between two hill that led them into a valley running south east the direction that they wished to take; but toward the end of the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land; it dark edge against the sky wa broken into many bare point like teeth of a blunted saw ,LOTR1,False
5450, they had a choice between going back or climbing over it ,LOTR1,False
5451, they decided to attempt the climb but it proved very difficult ,LOTR1,False
5452, before long frodo wa obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot ,LOTR1,False
5453, even so they often despaired of getting their pony up or indeed of finding a path for themselve burdened a they were ,LOTR1,False
5454, the light wa nearly gone and they were all exhausted when at last they reached the top ,LOTR1,False
5455, they had climbed on to a narrow saddle between two higher point and the land fell steeply away again only a short distance ahead ,LOTR1,False

5472, but do not give up hope sam ,LOTR1,False
5473, night wa cold up on the high ridge ,LOTR1,False
5474, they lit a small fire down under the gnarled root of an old pine that hung over a shallow pit: it looked a if stone had once been quarried there ,LOTR1,False
5475, the wind blew chill through the pas and they heard the tree top lower down moaning and sighing ,LOTR1,False
5476, frodo lay half in a dream imagining that endl dark wing were sweeping by above him and that on the wing rode pursuer that sought him in all the hollow of the hill ,LOTR1,False
5477, the morning dawned bright and fair; the air wa clean and the light pale and clear in a rain washed sky ,LOTR1,False

5484, we must make for the road again  he said ,LOTR1,False
5485, we cannot hope to find a path through these hill ,LOTR1,False
5486, whatever danger may beset it the road i our only way to the ford ,LOTR1,False
5487, a soon a they had eaten they set out again ,LOTR1,False
5488, they climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge; but the way wa much easier than they had expected for the slope wa far l steep on thi side and before long frodo wa able to ride again ,LOTR1,False
5489, bill ferny poor old pony wa developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path and for sparing it rider a many jolt a possible ,LOTR1,False

5493, suddenly he turned round and called to them ,LOTR1,False
5494, there i a path here ,LOTR1,False
5495, when they came up with him they saw that he had made no mistake: there were clearly the beginning of a path that climbed with many winding out of the wood below and faded away on the hill top behind ,LOTR1,False
5496, in place it wa now faint and overgrown or choked with fallen stone and trees; but at one time it seemed to have been much used ,LOTR1,False

5498, here and there old tree had been cut or broken down and large rock cloven or heaved aside to make a way ,LOTR1,False
5499, they followed the track for some while for it offered much the easiest way down but they went cautiously and their anxiety increased a they came into the dark wood and the path grew plainer and broader ,LOTR1,False
5500, suddenly coming out of a belt of fir tree it ran steeply down a slope and turned sharply to the left round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill ,LOTR1,False
5501, when they came to the comer they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level strip under the face of a low cliff overhung with tree ,LOTR1,False

5503, outside the door they all halted ,LOTR1,False
5504, there wa a cave or rock chamber behind but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen ,LOTR1,False
5505, strider sam and merry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door a little wider and then strider and merry went in ,LOTR1,False

5589, they were probably following the very track that gandalf bilbo and the dwarve had used many year before ,LOTR1,False
5590, after a few mile they came out on the top of a high bank above the road ,LOTR1,False
5591, at thi point the road had left the hoarwell far behind in it narrow valley and now clung close to the feet of the hill rolling and winding eastward among wood and heather covered slope toward the ford and the mountain ,LOTR1,False
5592, not far down the bank strider pointed out a stone in the gras ,LOTR1,False
5593, on it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen dwarf rune and secret mark ,LOTR1,False

5604, a cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountain ahead ,LOTR1,False
5605, they were beginning to look out for a place off the road where they could camp for the night when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into their hearts: the noise of hoof behind them ,LOTR1,False
5606, they looked back but they could not see far because of the many winding and rolling of the road ,LOTR1,False
5607, a quickly a they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into the deep heather and bilberry brushwood on the slope above until they came to a small patch of thick growing hazel ,LOTR1,False
5608, a they peered out from among the bushe they could see the road faint and grey in the failing light some thirty feel below them ,LOTR1,False
5609, the sound of hoof drew nearer ,LOTR1,False
5610, they were going fast with a light clippety clippely clip ,LOTR1,False
5611, then faintly a if it wa blown away from them by the breeze they seemed to catch a dim ringing a of small bell tinkling ,LOTR1,False
5612, that doe not sound like a black rider horse ,LOTR1,False
5613, the other hobbit agreed hopefully that it did not but they all remained full of suspicion ,LOTR1,False
5614, they had been in fear of pursuit for so long that any sound from behind seemed ominou and unfriendly ,LOTR1,False
5615, but strider wa now leaning forward stooped to the ground with a hand to hi ear and a look of joy on hi face ,LOTR1,False
5616, the light faded and the leave on the bushe rustled softly ,LOTR1,False
5617, clearer and nearer now the bell jingled and clippety clip came the quick trotting feet ,LOTR1,False
5618, suddenly into view below came a white horse gleaming in the shadow running swiftly ,LOTR1,False
5619, in the dusk it headstall flickered and flashed a if it were studded with gem like living star ,LOTR1,False
5620, the rider cloak streamed behind him and hi hood wa thrown back; hi golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of hi speed ,LOTR1,False
5621, to frodo it appeared that a white light wa shining through the form and raiment of the rider a if through a thin veil ,LOTR1,False
5622, strider sprang from hiding and dashed down toward the road leaping with a cry through the heather; but even before he had moved or called the rider had reined in hi horse and halted looking up toward the thicket where they stood ,LOTR1,False
5623, when he saw strider he dismounted and ran to meet him calling out: ai na vedui dnadan ,LOTR1,False
5624, hi speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in their hearts: the rider wa of the elven folk ,LOTR1,False
5625, no other that dwelt in the wide world had voice so fair to hear ,LOTR1,False
5626, but there seemed to be a note of haste or fear in hi call and they saw that he wa now speaking quickly and urgently to strider ,LOTR1,False
5627, soon strider beckoned to them and the hobbit left the bushe and hurried down to the road ,LOTR1,False
5628, thi i glorfindel who dwell in the house of elrond  said strider ,LOTR1,False
5629, hail and well met at last ,LOTR1,False
5630, said the elf lord to frodo ,LOTR1,False
5631, i wa sent from rivendell to look for you ,LOTR1,False
5632, we feared that you were in danger upon the road ,LOTR1,False
5633, then gandalf ha reached rivendell ,LOTR1,False
5634, he had not when i departed; but that wa nine day ago  answered glorfindel ,LOTR1,False
5635, elrond received new that troubled him ,LOTR1,False
5636, some of my kindred journeying in your land beyond the baranduin * learned that thing were amis and sent message a swiftly a they could ,LOTR1,False
5637, they said that the nine were abroad and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance for gandalf had not returned ,LOTR1,False
5638, there are few even in rivendell that can ride openly against the nine; but such a there were elrond sent out north west and south ,LOTR1,False
5639, it wa thought that you might turn far aside to avoid pursuit and become lost in the wildern ,LOTR1,False
5640, it wa my lot to take the road and i came to the bridge of mitheithel and left a token there nigh on seven day ago ,LOTR1,False
5641, three of the servant of sauron were upon the bridge but they withdrew and i pursued them westward ,LOTR1,False
5642, i came also upon two other but they turned away southward ,LOTR1,False
5643, since then i have searched for your trail ,LOTR1,False
5644, two day ago i found it and followed it over the bridge; and today i marked where you descended from the hill again ,LOTR1,False
5645, there i no time for further new ,LOTR1,False
5646, since you are here we must risk the peril of the road and go ,LOTR1,False
5647, there are five behind u and when they find your trail upon the road they will ride after u like the wind ,LOTR1,False
5648, and they are not all ,LOTR1,False
5649, where the other four may be i do not know ,LOTR1,False
5650, i fear that we may find the ford i already held against u ,LOTR1,False
5651, while glorfindel wa speaking the shade of evening deepened ,LOTR1,False
5652, frodo felt a great wearin come over him ,LOTR1,False
5653, ever since the sun began to sink the mist before hi eye had darkened and he felt that a shadow wa coming between him and the face of hi friend ,LOTR1,False
5654, now pain assailed him and he felt cold ,LOTR1,False
5655, he swayed clutching at sam arm ,LOTR1,False
5656, my master i sick and wounded  said sam angrily ,LOTR1,False
5657, he cant go on riding after nightfall ,LOTR1,False
5658, glorfindel caught frodo a he sank to the ground and taking him gently in hi arm he looked in hi face with grave anxiety ,LOTR1,False
5659, briefly strider told of the attack on their camp under weathertop and of the deadly knife ,LOTR1,False
5660, he drew out the hilt which he had kept and handed it to the elf ,LOTR1,False
5661, glorfindel shuddered a he took it but he looked intently at it ,LOTR1,False
5662, there are evil thing written on thi hilt  he said; though maybe your eye cannot see them ,LOTR1,False
5663, keep it aragorn till we reach the house of elrond ,LOTR1,False
5664, but be wary and handle it a little a you may ,LOTR1,False
5665, the wound of thi weapon are beyond my skill to heal ,LOTR1,False
5666, i will do what i can but all the more do i urge you now to go on without rest ,LOTR1,False
5667, he searched the wound on frodo shoulder with hi finger and hi face grew graver a if what he learned disquieted him ,LOTR1,False
5668, but frodo felt the chill lessen in hi side and arm; a little warmth crept down from hi shoulder to hi hand and the pain grew easier ,LOTR1,False
5669, the dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about him a if a cloud had been withdrawn ,LOTR1,False
5670, he saw hi friends face more clearly again and a measure of new hope and strength returned ,LOTR1,False
5671, you shall ride my horse  said glorfindel ,LOTR1,False
5672, i will shorten the stirrup up to the saddle skin and you must sit a tight a you can ,LOTR1,False
5673, but you need not fear: my horse will not let any rider fall that i command him to bear ,LOTR1,False
5674, hi pace i light and smooth; and if danger presse too near he will bear you away with a speed that even the black steed of the enemy cannot rival ,LOTR1,False
5675, i shall not ride him if i am to be carried off to rivendell or anywhere else leaving my friend behind in danger ,LOTR1,False
5676, i doubt very much  he said if your friend would be in danger if you were not with them ,LOTR1,False
5677, the pursuit would follow you and leave u in peace i think ,LOTR1,False
5678, it i you frodo and that which you bear that bring u all in peril ,LOTR1,False
5679, to that frodo had no answer and he wa persuaded to mount glorfindel white horse ,LOTR1,False
5680, the pony wa laden instead with a great part of the others burden so that they now marched lighter and for a time made good speed; but the hobbit began to find it hard to keep up with the swift tirel feet of the elf ,LOTR1,False
5681, on he led them into the mouth of darkn and still on under the deep clouded night ,LOTR1,False
5682, there wa neither star nor moon ,LOTR1,False
5683, not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to halt ,LOTR1,False
5684, pippin merry and sam were by that time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and even strider seemed by the sag of hi shoulder to be weary ,LOTR1,False
5685, frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream ,LOTR1,False
5686, they cast themselve down in the heather a few yard from the road side and fell asleep immediately ,LOTR1,False
5687, they seemed hardly to have closed their eye when glorfindel who had set himself to watch while they slept awoke them again ,LOTR1,False
5688, the sun had now climbed far into the morning and the cloud and mist of the night were gone ,LOTR1,False
5689, said glorfindel to them pouring for each in turn a little liquor from hi silver studded flask of leather ,LOTR1,False
5690, it wa clear a spring water and had no taste and it did not feel either cool or warm in the mouth; but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their limb a they drank it ,LOTR1,False
5691, eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit (which wa now all that they had left) seemed to satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the shire had done ,LOTR1,False
5692, they had rested rather l than five hour when they took to the road again ,LOTR1,False
5693, glorfindel still urged them on and only allowed two brief halt during the day march ,LOTR1,False
5694, in thi way they covered almost twenty mile before nightfall and came to a point where the road bent right and ran down toward the bottom of the valley now making straight for the bruinen ,LOTR1,False
5695, so far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbit could see or hear; but often glorfindel would halt and listen for a moment if they lagged behind and a look of anxiety clouded hi face ,LOTR1,False
5696, once or twice he spoke to strider in the elf tongue ,LOTR1,False
5697, but however anxiou their guide might be it wa plain that the hobbit could go no further that night ,LOTR1,False
5698, they were stumbling along dizzy with wearin and unable to think of anything but their feet and leg ,LOTR1,False
5699, frodo pain had redoubled and during the day thing about him faded to shadow of ghostly grey ,LOTR1,False
5700, he almost welcomed the coming of night for then the world seemed l pale and empty ,LOTR1,False
5701, the hobbit were still weary when they set out again early next morning ,LOTR1,False
5702, there were many mile yet to go between them and the ford and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage ,LOTR1,False
5703, our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river  said glorfindel; for my heart warn me that the pursuit i now swift behind u and other danger may be waiting by the ford ,LOTR1,False
5704, the road wa still running steadily downhill and there wa now in place much gras at either side in which the hobbit walked when they could to ease their tired feet ,LOTR1,False
5705, in the late afternoon they came to a place where the road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine tree and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist wall of red stone ,LOTR1,False
5706, echoe ran along a they hurried forward; and there seemed to be a sound of many footfall following their own ,LOTR1,False
5707, all at once a if through a gate of light the road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open ,LOTR1,False
5708, there at the bottom of a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile and beyond that the ford of rivendell ,LOTR1,False
5709, on the further side wa a steep brown bank threaded by a winding path; and behind that the tall mountain climbed shoulder above shoulder and peak beyond peak into the fading sky ,LOTR1,False
5710, there wa still an echo a of following feet in the cutting behind them; a rushing noise a if a wind were rising and pouring through the branche of the pine ,LOTR1,False
5711, one moment glorfindel turned and listened then he sprang forward with a loud cry ,LOTR1,False
5712, the enemy i upon us ,LOTR1,False
5713, the white horse leaped forward ,LOTR1,False
5714, the hobbit ran down the slope ,LOTR1,False
5715, glorfindel and strider followed a rear guard ,LOTR1,False
5716, they were only half way acros the flat when suddenly there wa a noise of horse galloping ,LOTR1,False
5717, out of the gate in the tree that they had just left rode a black rider ,LOTR1,False
5718, he reined hi horse in and halted swaying in hi saddle ,LOTR1,False
5719, another followed him and then another; then again two more ,LOTR1,False
5720, he did not obey at once for a strange reluctance seized him ,LOTR1,False
5721, checking the horse to a walk he turned and looked back ,LOTR1,False
5722, the rider seemed to sit upon their great steed like threatening statue upon a hill dark and solid while all the wood and land about them receded a if into a mist ,LOTR1,False
5723, suddenly he knew in hi heart that they were silently commanding him to wait ,LOTR1,False
5724, then at once fear and hatred awoke in him ,LOTR1,False
5725, hi hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of hi sword and with a red flash he drew it ,LOTR1,False
5726, cried glorfindel and then loud and clear he called to the horse in the elf tongue: noro lim noro lim asfaloth ,LOTR1,False
5727, at once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the road ,LOTR1,False
5728, at the same moment the black horse leaped down the hill in pursuit and from the rider came a terrible cry such a frodo had heard filling the wood with horror in the eastfarthing far away ,LOTR1,False
5729, it wa answered; and to the dismay of frodo and hi friend out from the tree and rock away on the left four other rider came flying ,LOTR1,False
5730, two rode toward frodo: two galloped madly toward the ford to cut off hi escape ,LOTR1,False
5731, they seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker a their course converged with hi ,LOTR1,False
5732, frodo looked back for a moment over hi shoulder ,LOTR1,False
5733, he could no longer see hi friend ,LOTR1,False
5734, the rider behind were falling back: even their great steed were no match in speed for the white elf horse of glorfindel ,LOTR1,False
5735, he looked forward again and hope faded ,LOTR1,False
5736, there seemed no chance of reaching the ford before he wa cut off by the other that had lain in ambush ,LOTR1,False
5737, he could see them clearly now: they appeared to have cast aside their hood and black cloak and they were robed in white and grey ,LOTR1,False
5738, sword were naked in their pale hands; helm were on their head ,LOTR1,False
5739, their cold eye glittered and they called to him with fell voice ,LOTR1,False
5740, fear now filled all frodo mind ,LOTR1,False
5741, he thought no longer of hi sword ,LOTR1,False
5742, no cry came from him ,LOTR1,False
5743, he shut hi eye and clung to the horse mane ,LOTR1,False
5744, the wind whistled in hi ear and the bell upon the harn rang wild and shrill ,LOTR1,False
5745, a breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear a with a last spurt like a flash of white fire the elf horse speeding a if on wing passed right before the face of the foremost rider ,LOTR1,False
5746, frodo heard the splash of water ,LOTR1,False
5747, it foamed about hi feet ,LOTR1,False
5748, he felt the quick heave and surge a the horse left the river and struggled up the stony path ,LOTR1,False
5749, he wa climbing the steep bank ,LOTR1,False
5750, he wa acros the ford ,LOTR1,False
5751, but the pursuer were close behind ,LOTR1,False
5752, at the top of the bank the horse halted and turned about neighing fiercely ,LOTR1,False
5753, there were nine rider at the water edge below and frodo spirit quailed before the threat of their uplifted face ,LOTR1,False
5754, he knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing a easily a he had done; and he felt that it wa usel to try to escape over the long uncertain path from the ford to the edge of rivendell if once the rider crossed ,LOTR1,False
5755, in any case he felt that he wa commanded urgently to halt ,LOTR1,False
5756, hatred again stirred in him but he had no longer the strength to refuse ,LOTR1,False
5757, suddenly the foremost rider spurred hi horse forward ,LOTR1,False
5758, it checked at the water and reared up ,LOTR1,False
5759, with a great effort frodo sat upright and brandished hi sword ,LOTR1,False
5760, go back to the land of mordor and follow me no more ,LOTR1,False
5761,  hi voice sounded thin and shrill in hi own ear ,LOTR1,False

5763, hi enemie laughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughter ,LOTR1,False
5764, to mordor we will take you ,LOTR1,False
5765, they cried with deadly voices; and immediately their leader urged hi horse forward into the water followed closely by two other ,LOTR1,False
5766, by elbereth and lthien the fair  said frodo with a last effort lifting up hi sword you shall have neither the ring nor me ,LOTR1,False
5767, then the leader who wa now half acros the ford stood up menacing in hi stirrup and raised up hi hand ,LOTR1,False
5768, he felt hi tongue cleave to hi mouth and hi heart labouring ,LOTR1,False
5769, hi sword broke and fell out of hi shaking hand ,LOTR1,False
5770, the elf horse reared and snorted ,LOTR1,False
5771, the foremost of the black horse had almost set foot upon the shore ,LOTR1,False
5772, at that moment there came a roaring and a rushing: a noise of loud water rolling many stone ,LOTR1,False
5773, dimly frodo saw the river below him rise and down along it course there came a plumed cavalry of wave ,LOTR1,False
5774, white flame seemed to frodo to flicker on their crest and he half fancied that he saw amid the water white rider upon white horse with frothing mane ,LOTR1,False
5775, the three rider that were still in the midst of the ford were overwhelmed: they disappeared buried suddenly under angry foam ,LOTR1,False
5776, those that were behind drew back in dismay ,LOTR1,False
5777, with hi last failing sense frodo heard crie and it seemed to him that he saw beyond the rider that hesitated on the shore a shining figure of white light; and behind it ran small shadowy form waving flame that flared red in the grey mist that wa falling over the world ,LOTR1,False
5778, the black horse were filled with madn and leaping forward in terror they bore their rider into the rushing flood ,LOTR1,False
5779, their piercing crie were drowned in the roaring of the river a it carried them away ,LOTR1,False

5781, he heard and saw no more ,LOTR1,False
5782, * book ii * chapter number ,LOTR1,False
5783, many meeting frodo woke and found himself lying in bed ,LOTR1,False
5784, at first he thought that he had slept late after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory ,LOTR1,False
5785, or perhap he had been ill ,LOTR1,False
5786, but the ceiling looked strange; it wa flat and it had dark beam richly carved ,LOTR1,False
5787, he lay a little while longer looking at patche of sunlight on the wall and listening to the sound of a waterfall ,LOTR1,False
5788, where am i and what i the time ,LOTR1,False

5822, i wish you would tell me what happened ,LOTR1,False
5823, you are not supposed to talk or worry about anything today by elrond order ,LOTR1,False

5883, well four night and three day to be exact ,LOTR1,False
5884, the elve brought you from thi where you lost count ,LOTR1,False
5885, we have been terribly anxiou and sam ha hardly left your side day or night except to run message ,LOTR1,False
5886, elrond i a master of healing but the weapon of our enemy are deadly ,LOTR1,False
5887, to tell you the truth i had very little hope; for i suspected that there wa some fragment of the blade still in the closed wound ,LOTR1,False
5888, but it could not be found until last night ,LOTR1,False
5889, then elrond removed a splinter ,LOTR1,False
5890, it wa deeply buried and it wa working inward ,LOTR1,False
5891, frodo shuddered remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that had vanished in strider hand ,LOTR1,False
5892, and it seem that hobbit fade very reluctantly ,LOTR1,False
5893, i have known strong warrior of the big people who would quickly have been overcome by that splinter which you bore for seventeen day ,LOTR1,False
5894, what would they have done to me ,LOTR1,False
5895, what were the rider trying to do ,LOTR1,False
5896, they tried to pierce your heart with a morgul knife which remain in the wound ,LOTR1,False
5897, if they had succeeded you would have become like they are only weaker and under their command ,LOTR1,False
5898, you would have became a wraith under the dominion of the dark lord; and he would have tormented you for trying to keep hi ring if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it and seeing it on hi hand ,LOTR1,False
5899, thank goodn i did not realize the horrible danger ,LOTR1,False
5900, i wa mortally afraid of course; but if i had known more i should not have dared even to move ,LOTR1,False
5901, it i a marvel that i escaped ,LOTR1,False
5902, ye fortune or fate have helped you  said gandalf not to mention courage ,LOTR1,False
5903, for your heart wa not touched and only your shoulder wa pierced; and that wa because you resisted to the last ,LOTR1,False
5904, but it wa a terribly narrow shave so to speak ,LOTR1,False
5905, you were in gravest peril while you wore the ring for then you were half in the wraith world yourself and they might have seized you ,LOTR1,False
5906, you could see them and they could see you ,LOTR1,False
5907, i know  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
5908, they were terrible to behold ,LOTR1,False
5909, but why could we all see their horses ,LOTR1,False
5910, because they are real horses; just a the black robe are real robe that they wear to give shape to their nothingn when they have dealing with the living ,LOTR1,False
5911, then why do these black horse endure such riders ,LOTR1,False
5912, all other animal are terrified when they draw near even the elf horse of glorfindel ,LOTR1,False
5913, the dog howl and the geese scream at them ,LOTR1,False
5914, because these horse are born and bred to the service of the dark lord in mordor ,LOTR1,False
5915, not all hi servant and chattel are wraiths ,LOTR1,False
5916, there are ore and troll there are warg and werewolves; and there have been and still are many men warrior and king that walk alive under the sun and yet are under hi sway ,LOTR1,False
5917, and their number i growing daily ,LOTR1,False
5918, what about rivendell and the elves ,LOTR1,False
5919, ye at present until all else i conquered ,LOTR1,False
5920, the elve may fear the dark lord and they may fly before him but never again will they listen to him or serve him ,LOTR1,False
5921, and here in rivendell there live still some of hi chief foes: the elven wise lord of the eldar from beyond the furthest sea ,LOTR1,False
5922, they do not fear the ringwraith for those who have dwelt in the blessed realm live at once in both world and against both the seen and the unseen they have great power ,LOTR1,False
5923, i thought that i saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim like the other ,LOTR1,False
5924, ye you saw him for a moment a he i upon the other side: one of the mighty of the firstborn ,LOTR1,False
5925, lie i an elf lord of a house of prince ,LOTR1,False
5926, indeed there i a power in rivendell to withstand the might of mordor for a while: and elsewhere other power still dwell ,LOTR1,False
5927, there i power too of another kind in the shire ,LOTR1,False
5928, but all such place will soon become island under siege if thing go on a they are going ,LOTR1,False
5929, the dark lord i putting forth all hi strength ,LOTR1,False
5930, still  he said standing suddenly up and sticking out hi chin while hi beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire we must keep up our courage ,LOTR1,False
5931, you will soon be well if i do not talk you to death ,LOTR1,False
5932, you are in rivendell and you need not worry about anything for the present ,LOTR1,False

5934, just give me new of my friend and tell me the end of the affair at the ford a i keep on asking and i shall be content for the present ,LOTR1,False
5935, after that i shall have another sleep i think; but i shant be able to close my eye until you have finished the story for me ,LOTR1,False
5936, gandalf moved hi chair to the bedside and took a good look at frodo ,LOTR1,False
5937, the colour had come back to hi face and hi eye were clear and fully awake and aware ,LOTR1,False
5938, he wa smiling and there seemed to be little wrong with him ,LOTR1,False
5939, but to the wizard eye there wa a faint change just a hint a it were of transparency about him and especially about the left hand that lay outside upon the coverlet ,LOTR1,False
5940, still that must be expected  said gandalf to himself ,LOTR1,False
5941, he i not half through yet and to what he will come in the end not even elrond can foretell ,LOTR1,False
5942, not to evil i think ,LOTR1,False
5943, he may become like a glas filled with a clear light for eye to see that can ,LOTR1,False
5944, you look splendid  he said aloud ,LOTR1,False
5945, i will risk a brief tale without consulting elrond ,LOTR1,False
5946, but quite brief mind you and then you must sleep again ,LOTR1,False
5947, thi i what happened a far a i can gather ,LOTR1,False
5948, the rider made straight for you a soon a you fled ,LOTR1,False
5949, they did not need the guidance of their horse any longer: you had become visible to them being already on the threshold of their world ,LOTR1,False
5950, and also the ring drew them ,LOTR1,False
5951, your friend sprang aside off the road or they would have been ridden down ,LOTR1,False
5952, they knew that nothing could save you if the white horse could not ,LOTR1,False
5953, the rider were too swift to overtake and too many to oppose ,LOTR1,False
5954, on foot even glorfindel and aragorn together could not with stand all the nine at once ,LOTR1,False
5955, when the ring wraith swept by your friend ran up behind ,LOTR1,False
5956, close to the ford there i a small hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted tree ,LOTR1,False
5957, there they hastily kindled fire; for glorfindel knew that a flood would come down if the rider tried to cros and then he would have to deal with any that were left on hi side of the river ,LOTR1,False
5958, the moment the flood appeared he rushed out followed by aragorn and the ,LOTR1,False
5959, caught between fire and water and seeing an elf lord revealed in hi wrath they were dismayed and their horse were stricken with madn ,LOTR1,False
5960, three were carried away by the first assault of the flood; the other were now hurled into the water by their horse and overwhelmed ,LOTR1,False
5961, and i that the end of the black riders ,LOTR1,False
5962, their horse must have perished and without them they are crippled ,LOTR1,False
5963, but the ringwraith themselve cannot be so easily destroyed ,LOTR1,False
5964, however there i nothing more to fear from them at present ,LOTR1,False
5965, your friend crossed after the flood had passed; and they found you lying on your face at the top of the bank with a broken sword under you ,LOTR1,False
5966, the horse wa standing guard beside you ,LOTR1,False
5967, you were pale and cold and they feared that you were dead or worse ,LOTR1,False
5968, elrond folk met them carrying you slowly toward ri vendell ,LOTR1,False
5969,  who made the flood ,LOTR1,False
5970, elrond commanded it  answered gandalf ,LOTR1,False
5971, the river of thi valley i under hi power and it will rise in anger when he ha great need to bar the ford ,LOTR1,False
5972, a soon a the captain of the ringwraith rode into the water the flood wa released ,LOTR1,False
5973, if i may say so i added a few touche of my own: you may not have noticed but some of the wave took the form of great white horse with shining white riders; and there were many rolling and grinding boulder ,LOTR1,False
5974, for a moment i wa afraid that we had let loose too fierce a wrath and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away ,LOTR1,False
5975, there i great vigour in the water that come down from the snow of the misty mountain ,LOTR1,False
5976, ye it all come back to me now  said frodo: the tremendou roaring ,LOTR1,False
5977, i thought i wa drowning with my friend and enemie and all ,LOTR1,False
5978, but now we are safe ,LOTR1,False
5979, gandalf looked quickly at frodo but he had shut hi eye ,LOTR1,False
5980, ye you are all safe for the present ,LOTR1,False
5981, soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to celebrate the victory at the ford of bruinen and you will all be there in place of honour ,LOTR1,False
5982, it i wonderful that elrond and glorfindel and such great lord not to mention strider should take so much trouble and show me so much kindn ,LOTR1,False
5983, well there are many reason why they should  said gandalf smiling ,LOTR1,False
5984, i am one good reason ,LOTR1,False
5985, the ring i another: you are the ring bearer ,LOTR1,False
5986, and you are the heir of bilbo the ring finder ,LOTR1,False
5987, i wonder where he i ,LOTR1,False
5988, i wish he wa here and could hear all about it ,LOTR1,False
5989, it would have made him laugh the cow jumped over the moon ,LOTR1,False
5990, and the poor old troll ,LOTR1,False
5991, with that he fell fast asleep ,LOTR1,False
5992, frodo wa now safe in the fast homely house east of the sea ,LOTR1,False
5993, that house wa a bilbo had long ago reported a perfect house whether you like food or sleep or story telling or singing or just sitting and thinking best or a pleasant mixture of them all ,LOTR1,False
5994, merely to be there wa a cure for wearin fear and sadn ,LOTR1,False
5995, a the evening drew on frodo woke up again and he found that he no longer felt in need of rest or sleep but had a mind for food and drink and probably for singing and story telling afterward ,LOTR1,False
5996, he got out of bed and discovered that hi arm wa already nearly a useful again a it ever had been ,LOTR1,False
5997, he found laid ready clean garment of green cloth that fitted him excellently ,LOTR1,False
5998, looking in a mirror he wa startled to see a much thinner reflection of himself than he remembered: it looked remarkably like the young nephew of bilbo who used to go tramping with hi uncle in the shire; but the eye looked out at him thoughtfully ,LOTR1,False
5999, ye you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a looking glas  he said to hi reflection ,LOTR1,False
6000, but now for a merry meeting ,LOTR1,False
6001, he stretched out hi arm and whistled a tune ,LOTR1,False
6002, at that moment there wa a knock on the door and sam came in ,LOTR1,False
6003, he ran to frodo and took hi left hand awkwardly and shyly ,LOTR1,False
6004, he stroked it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away ,LOTR1,False
6005, meaning your hand mr frodo ,LOTR1,False
6006, it ha felt so cold through the long night ,LOTR1,False
6007, he cried turning round again with shining eye and dancing on the floor ,LOTR1,False
6008, it fine to see you up and yourself again sir ,LOTR1,False

6016, some like king terrible and splendid; and some a merry a children ,LOTR1,False
6017, and the music and the singing not that i have had the time or the heart for much listening since we got here ,LOTR1,False
6018, but im getting to know some of the way of the place ,LOTR1,False
6019, i know what you have been doing sam  said frodo taking hi arm ,LOTR1,False
6020, but you shall be merry tonight and listen to your heart content ,LOTR1,False
6021, come on guide me round the corners ,LOTR1,False
6022, sam led him along several passage and down many step and out into a high garden above the steep bank of the river ,LOTR1,False
6023, he found hi friend sitting in a porch on the side of the house looking east ,LOTR1,False
6024, shadow had fallen in the valley below but there wa still a light on the face of the mountain far above ,LOTR1,False
6025, the sound of running and falling water wa loud and the evening wa filled with a faint scent of tree and flower a if summer still lingered in elrond garden ,LOTR1,False
6026, here i our noble cousin ,LOTR1,False
6027, make way for frodo lord of the ring ,LOTR1,False
6028, said gandalf from the shadow at the back of the porch ,LOTR1,False
6029, evil thing do not come into thi valley; but all the same we should not name them ,LOTR1,False
6030, the lord of the ring i not frodo but the master of the dark tower of mordor whose power i again stretching out over the world ,LOTR1,False
6031, we are sitting in a fortr ,LOTR1,False
6032, outside it i getting dark ,LOTR1,False
6033, gandalf ha been saying many cheerful thing like that  said pippin ,LOTR1,False
6034, he think i need keeping in order ,LOTR1,False
6035, but it seem impossible somehow to feel gloomy or depressed in thi place ,LOTR1,False
6036, i feel i could sing if i knew the right song for the occasion ,LOTR1,False
6037, i feel like singing myself  laughed frodo ,LOTR1,False
6038, though at the moment i feel more like eating and drinking ,LOTR1,False
6039, that will soon be cured  said pippin ,LOTR1,False
6040, you have shown your usual cunning in getting up just in time for a meal ,LOTR1,False
6041, a soon a gandalf reported that you were recovered the preparation began ,LOTR1,False
6042, he had hardly finished speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bell ,LOTR1,False
6043, the hall of elrond house wa filled with folk: elve for the most part though there were a few guest of other sort ,LOTR1,False
6044, elrond a wa hi custom sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and next to him on the one side sat glorfindel on the other side sat gandalf ,LOTR1,False
6045, frodo looked at them in wonder for he had never before seen elrond of whom so many tale spoke; and a they sat upon hi right hand and hi left glorfindel and even gandalf whom he thought he knew so well were revealed a lord of dignity and power ,LOTR1,False
6046, gandalf wa shorter in stature than the other two; but hi long white hair hi sweeping silver beard and hi broad shoulder made him look like some wise king of ancient legend ,LOTR1,False
6047, in hi aged face under great snowy brow hi dark eye were set like coal that could leap suddenly into fire ,LOTR1,False
6048, glorfindel wa tall and straight; hi hair wa of shining gold hi face fair and young and fearl and full of joy; hi eye were bright and keen and hi voice like music; on hi brow sat wisdom and in hi hand wa strength ,LOTR1,False
6049, the face of elrond wa agel neither old nor young though in it wa written the memory of many thing both glad and sorrowful ,LOTR1,False
6050, hi hair wa dark a the shadow of twilight and upon it wa set a circlet of silver; hi eye were grey a a clear evening and in them wa a light like the light of star ,LOTR1,False
6051, venerable he seemed a a king crowned with many winter and yet hale a a tried warrior in the fuln of hi strength ,LOTR1,False
6052, he wa the lord of rivendell and mighty among both elve and men ,LOTR1,False
6053, in the middle of the table against the woven cloth upon the wall there wa a chair under a canopy and there sat a lady fair to look upon and so like wa she in form of womanhood to elrond that frodo guessed that she wa one of hi close kindred ,LOTR1,False
6054, young she wa and yet not so ,LOTR1,False
6055, the braid of her dark hair were touched by no frost her white arm and clear face were flawl and smooth and the light of star wa in her bright eye grey a a cloudl night; yet queenly she looked and thought and knowledge were in her glance a of one who ha known many thing that the year bring ,LOTR1,False
6056, above her brow her head wa covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gem glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leave wrought in silver ,LOTR1,False
6057, so it wa that frodo saw her whom few mortal had yet seen; arwen daughter of elrond in whom it wa said that the liken of lthien had come on earth again; and she wa called undumiel for she wa the evenstar of her people ,LOTR1,False
6058, long she had been in the land of her mother kin in lurien beyond the mountain and wa but lately returned to rivendell to her father house ,LOTR1,False
6059, but her brother elladan and elrohir were out upon errantry: for they rode often far afield with the ranger of the north forgetting never their mother torment in the den of the ore ,LOTR1,False
6060, such lovelin in living thing frodo had never seen before nor imagined in hi mind; and he wa both surprised and abashed to find that he had a seat at elrond table among all these folk so high and fair ,LOTR1,False
6061, though he had a suitable chair and wa raised upon several cushion he felt very small and rather out of place; but that feeling quickly passed ,LOTR1,False
6062, the feast wa merry and the food all that hi hunger could desire ,LOTR1,False
6063, it wa some time before he looked about him again or even turned to hi neighbour ,LOTR1,False
6064, he looked first for hi friend ,LOTR1,False
6065, sam had begged to be allowed to wait on hi master but had been told that for thi time he wa a guest of honour ,LOTR1,False
6066, frodo could see him now sitting with pippin and merry at the upper end of one of the side table close to the dai ,LOTR1,False
6067, he could see no sign of strider ,LOTR1,False
6068, next to frodo on hi right sat a dwarf of important appearance richly dressed ,LOTR1,False
6069, hi beard very long and forked wa white nearly a white a the snow white cloth of hi garment ,LOTR1,False
6070, he wore a silver belt and round hi neck hung a chain of silver and diamond ,LOTR1,False
6071, frodo stopped eating to look at him ,LOTR1,False
6072, said the dwarf turning toward him ,LOTR1,False
6073, then he actually rose from hi seat and bowed ,LOTR1,False
6074, gluin at your service  he said and bowed still lower ,LOTR1,False
6075, frodo baggin at your service and your family  said frodo correctly rising in surprise and scattering hi cushion ,LOTR1,False
6076, am i right in guessing that you are the gluin one of the twelve companion of the great thorin oaken shield ,LOTR1,False
6077, quite right  answered the dwarf gathering up the cushion and courteously assisting frodo back into hi seat ,LOTR1,False
6078, and i do not ask for i have already been told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of our friend bilbo the renowned ,LOTR1,False
6079, allow me to congratulate you on your recovery ,LOTR1,False
6080, thank you very much  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
6081, you have had some very strange adventure i hear  said gluin ,LOTR1,False
6082, i wonder greatly what bring four hobbit on so long a journey ,LOTR1,False
6083, nothing like it ha happened since bilbo came with u ,LOTR1,False
6084, but perhap i should not inquire too closely since elrond and gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this ,LOTR1,False
6085, i think we will not speak of it at least not yet  said frodo politely ,LOTR1,False
6086, he guessed that even in elrond house the matter of the ring wa not one for casual talk; and in any case he wished to forget hi trouble for a time ,LOTR1,False
6087, but i am equally curiou  he added to learn what bring so important a dwarf so far from the lonely mountain ,LOTR1,False
6088, if you have not heard i think we will not speak yet of that either ,LOTR1,False
6089, master elrond will summon u all ere long i believe and then we shall all hear many thing ,LOTR1,False
6090, but there i much else that may be told ,LOTR1,False
6091, throughout the rest of the meal they talked together but frodo listened more than he spoke; for the new of the shire apart from the ring seemed small and far away and unimportant while gluin had much to tell of event in the northern region of wilderland ,LOTR1,False
6092, frodo learned that grimbeorn the old son of beorn wa now the lord of many sturdy men and to their land between the mountain and mirkwood neither ore nor wolf dared to go ,LOTR1,False
6093, indeed  said gluin if it were not for the beorning the passage from dale to rivendell would long ago have become impossible ,LOTR1,False
6094, they are valiant men and keep open the high pas and the ford of carrock ,LOTR1,False
6095, but their toll are high  he added with a shake of hi head; and like beorn of old they are not over fond of dwarve ,LOTR1,False
6096, still they are trusty and that i much in these day ,LOTR1,False
6097, nowhere are there any men so friendly to u a the men of dale ,LOTR1,False
6098, they are good folk the barding ,LOTR1,False
6099, the grandson of bard the bowman rule them brand son of bain son of bard ,LOTR1,False
6100, he i a strong king and hi realm now reache far south and east of esgaroth ,LOTR1,False
6101, and what of your own people ,LOTR1,False
6102, there i much to tell good and bad  said gluin; yet it i mostly good: we have so far been fortunate though we do not escape the shadow of these time ,LOTR1,False
6103, if you really wish to hear of u i will tell you tiding gladly ,LOTR1,False
6104, but stop me when you are weary ,LOTR1,False
6105, dwarves tongue run on when speaking of their handiwork they say ,LOTR1,False
6106, and with that gluin embarked on a long account of the doing of the dwarf kingdom ,LOTR1,False
6107, he wa delighted to have found so polite a listener; for frodo showed no sign of wearin and made no attempt to change the subject though actually he soon got rather lost among the strange name of people and place that he had never heard of before ,LOTR1,False
6108, he wa interested however to hear that dbin wa still king under the mountain and wa now old (having passed hi two hundred and fiftieth year) venerable and fabulously rich ,LOTR1,False
6109, of the ten companion who had survived the battle of five armie seven were still with him: dwalin gluin dori nori bifur bofur and bombur ,LOTR1,False
6110, bombur wa now so fat that he could not move himself from hi couch to hi chair at table and it took six young dwarve to lift him ,LOTR1,False
6111, and what ha become of balin and ori and uin ,LOTR1,False
6112, a shadow passed over gluin face ,LOTR1,False
6113, we do not know  he answered ,LOTR1,False
6114, it i largely on account of balin that i have come to ask the advice of those that dwell in rivendell ,LOTR1,False
6115, but tonight let u speak of merrier things ,LOTR1,False
6116, gluin began then to talk of the work of hi people telling frodo about their great labour in dale and under the mountain ,LOTR1,False
6117, we have done well  he said ,LOTR1,False
6118, but in metalwork we cannot rival our father many of whose secret are lost ,LOTR1,False
6119, we make good armour and keen sword but we cannot again make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon came ,LOTR1,False
6120, only in mining and building have we surpassed the old day ,LOTR1,False
6121, you should see the waterway of dale frodo and the fountain and the pools ,LOTR1,False
6122, you should see the stone paved road of many colours ,LOTR1,False
6123, and the hall and cavernou street under the earth with arche carved like trees; and the terrace and tower upon the mountain sides ,LOTR1,False
6124, then you would see that we have not been idle ,LOTR1,False
6125, i will come and see them if ever i can  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
6126, how surprised bilbo would have been to see all the change in the desolation of smaug ,LOTR1,False

6226, every item of new from the shire that frodo could tell aided and corrected now and again by sam wa of the greatest interest to him from the felling of the least tree to the prank of the smallest child in hobbiton ,LOTR1,False
6227, they were so deep in the doing of the four farthing that they did not notice the arrival of a man clad in dark green cloth ,LOTR1,False

6252, but those near him were silent intent upon the music of the voice and the instrument and they gave no heed to anything else ,LOTR1,False
6253, at first the beauty of the melodie and of the interwoven word in elven tongue even though he understood them little held him in a spell a soon a he began to attend to them ,LOTR1,False

6255, then the enchantment became more and more dreamlike until he felt that an endl river of swelling gold and silver wa flowing over him too multitudinou for it pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air about him and it drenched and drowned him ,LOTR1,False
6256, swiftly he sank under it shining weight into a deep realm of sleep ,LOTR1,False
6257, there he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running water and then suddenly into a voice ,LOTR1,False

6259, faint at first and then clearer ran the word ,LOTR1,False
6260, edrendil wa a mariner that tarried in arvernien; he built a boat of timber felled in nimbrethil to journey in; her sail he wove of silver fair of silver were her lantern made her prow wa fashioned like a swan and light upon her banner laid ,LOTR1,False

6266, the silmaril she bound on him and crowned him with the living light and dauntl then with burning brow he turned hi prow; and in the night from otherworld beyond the sea there strong and free a storm arose a wind of power in tarmenel; by path that seldom mortal goe hi boat it bore with biting breath a might of death acros the grey and long forsaken sea distressed: from east to west he passed away ,LOTR1,False
6267, through evernight he back wa borne on black and roaring wave that ran oer league unlit and foundered shore that drowned before the day began until he heard on strand of pearl when end the world the music long where ever foaming billow roll the yellow gold and jewel wan ,LOTR1,False
6268, he saw the mountain silent rise where twilight lie upon the knee of valinor and eldamar beheld afar beyond the sea ,LOTR1,False

6273, a ship then new they built for him of mithril and of elven glas with shining prow; no shaven oar nor sail she bore on silver mast: the silmaril a lantern light and banner bright with living flame to gleam thereon by elbereth herself wa set who thither came and wing immortal made for him and laid on him undying doom to sail the shorel skie and come behind the sun and light of moon ,LOTR1,False
6274, from evereven lofty hill where softly silver fountain fall hi wing him bore a wandering light beyond the mighty mountain wall ,LOTR1,False
6275, from world end then he turned away and yearned again to find afar hi home through shadow journeying and burning a an island star on high above the mist he came a distant flame before the sun a wonder ere the waking dawn where grey the norland water run ,LOTR1,False
6276, and over middle earth he passed and heard at last the weeping sore of women and of elven maid in elder day in year of yore gut on him mighty doom wa laid till moon should fade an orb d star to pas and tarry never more on hither shore where mortal are; for ever still a herald on an errand that should never rest to bear hi shining lamp afar the flammifer of westernesse ,LOTR1,False

6387, much wa said of event in the world outside especially in the south and in the wide land east of the mountain ,LOTR1,False
6388, of these thing frodo had already heard many rumours; but the tale of gluin wa new to him and when the dwarf spoke he listened attentively ,LOTR1,False
6389, it appeared that amid the splendour of their work of hand the heart of the dwarve of the lonely mountain were troubled ,LOTR1,False
6390, it i now many year ago  said gluin that a shadow of disquiet fell upon our people ,LOTR1,False
6391, whence it came we did not at first perceive ,LOTR1,False
6392, word began to be whispered in secret : it wa said that we were hemmed in a narrow place and that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world ,LOTR1,False
6393, some spoke of moria: the mighty work of our father that are called in our own tongue khazad dym; and they declared that now at last we had the power and number to return ,LOTR1,False
6394, wonder of the northern world ,LOTR1,False
6395, too deep we delved there and woke the namel fear ,LOTR1,False
6396, long have it vast mansion lain empty since the children of durin fled ,LOTR1,False
6397, but now we spoke of it again with longing and yet with dread; for no dwarf ha dared to pas the door of khazad dym for many live of king save thrur only and he perished ,LOTR1,False
6398, at last however balin listened to the whisper and resolved to go; and though dbin did not give leave willingly he took with him ori and uin and many of our folk and they went away south ,LOTR1,False
6399, that wa nigh on thirty year ago ,LOTR1,False
6400, for a while we had new and it seemed good: message reported that moria had been entered and a great work begun there ,LOTR1,False
6401, then there wa silence and no word ha ever come from moria since ,LOTR1,False
6402, then about a year ago a messenger came to dbin but not from moria from mordor: a horseman in the night who called dbin to hi gate ,LOTR1,False
6403, the lord sauron the great so he said wished for our friendship ,LOTR1,False
6404, ring he would give for it such a he gave of old ,LOTR1,False
6405, and he asked urgently concerning hobbit of what kind they were and where they dwelt ,LOTR1,False
6406, for sauron know said he that one of these wa known to you on a time ,LOTR1,False
6407, at thi we were greatly troubled and we gave no answer ,LOTR1,False
6408, and then hi fell voice wa lowered and he would have sweetened it if he could ,LOTR1,False
6409, a a small token only of your friendship sauron ask thi he said: that you should find thi thief such wa hi word and get from him willing or no a little ring the least of ring that once he stole ,LOTR1,False
6410, it i but a trifle that sauron fancie and an earnest of your good will ,LOTR1,False
6411, find it and three ring that the dwarf sire possessed of old shall be returned to you and the realm of moria shall be your for ever ,LOTR1,False
6412, find only new of the thief whether he still live and where and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the lord ,LOTR1,False
6413, refuse and thing will not seem so well ,LOTR1,False
6414, at that hi breath came like the his of snake and all who stood by shuddered but dbin said: i say neither yea nor nay ,LOTR1,False
6415, i must consider thi message and what it mean under it fair cloak ,LOTR1,False
6416,  consider well but not too long said he ,LOTR1,False
6417, the time of my thought i my own to spend answered dbin ,LOTR1,False
6418,  for the present said he and rode into the darkn ,LOTR1,False
6419, heavy have the heart of our chieftain been since that night ,LOTR1,False
6420, we needed not the fell voice of the messenger to warn u that hi word held both menace and deceit; for we knew already that the power that ha re entered mordor ha not changed and ever it betrayed u of old ,LOTR1,False
6421, twice the messenger ha returned and ha gone unanswered ,LOTR1,False
6422, the third and last time so he say i soon to come before the ending of the year ,LOTR1,False
6423, and so i have been sent at last by dbin to warn bilbo that he i sought by the enemy and to learn if may be why he desire thi ring thi least of ring ,LOTR1,False
6424, also we crave the advice of elrond ,LOTR1,False
6425, for the shadow grow and draw nearer ,LOTR1,False
6426, we discover that messenger have come also to king brand in dale and that he i afraid ,LOTR1,False
6427, we fear that he may yield ,LOTR1,False
6428, already war i gathering on hi eastern border ,LOTR1,False
6429, if we make no answer the enemy may move men of hi rule to assail king brand and dbin also ,LOTR1,False
6430, you have done well to come  said elrond ,LOTR1,False
6431, you will hear today all that you need in order to understand the purpose of the enemy ,LOTR1,False
6432, there i naught that you can do other than to resist with hope or without it ,LOTR1,False
6433, but you do not stand alone ,LOTR1,False
6434, you will learn that your trouble i but part of the trouble of all the western world ,LOTR1,False
6435, what shall we do with the ring the least of ring the trifle that sauron fancies ,LOTR1,False
6436, that i the doom that we must deem ,LOTR1,False
6437, that i the purpose for which you are called hither ,LOTR1,False
6438, though i have not called you to me stranger from distant land ,LOTR1,False
6439, you have come and are here met in thi very nick of time by chance a it may seem ,LOTR1,False
6440, yet it i not so ,LOTR1,False
6441, believe rather that it i so ordered that we who sit here and none other must now find counsel for the peril of the world ,LOTR1,False
6442, now therefore thing shall be openly spoken that have been hidden from all but a few until thi day ,LOTR1,False
6443, and first so that all may understand what i the peril the tale of the ring shall be told from the beginning even to thi present ,LOTR1,False
6444, and i will begin that tale though other shall end it ,LOTR1,False
6445, then all listened while elrond in hi clear voice spoke of sauron and the ring of power and their forging in the second age of the world long ago ,LOTR1,False
6446, a part of hi tale wa known to some there but the full tale to none and many eye were turned t= elrond in fear and wonder a he told of the elven smith of eregion and their friendship with moria and their eagern for knowledge by which sauron ensnared them ,LOTR1,False
6447, for in that time he wa not yet evil to behold and they received hi aid and grew mighty in craft wherea he learned all their secret and betrayed them and forged secretly in the mountain of fire the one ring to be their master ,LOTR1,False
6448, but celebrimbor wa aware of him and hid the three which he had made; and there wa war and the land wa laid waste and the gate of moria wa shut ,LOTR1,False
6449, then through all the year that followed he traced the ring; but since that history i elsewhere recounted even a elrond himself set it down in hi book of lore it i not here recalled ,LOTR1,False
6450, for it i a long tale full of deed great and terrible and briefly though elrond spoke the sun rode up the sky and the morning wa passing ere he ceased ,LOTR1,False
6451, of nmenor he spoke it glory and it fall and the return of the king of men to middle earth out of the deep of the sea borne upon the wing of storm ,LOTR1,False
6452, then elendil the tall and hi mighty son isildur and anbrion became great lords; and the north realm they made in arnor and the south realm in gondor above the mouth of anduin ,LOTR1,False
6453, but sauron of mordor assailed them and they made the last alliance of elve and men and the host of gil galad and elendil were mustered in arnor ,LOTR1,False
6454, thereupon elrond paused a while and sighed ,LOTR1,False
6455, i remember well the splendour of their banner  he said ,LOTR1,False
6456, v it recalled to me the glory of the elder day and the host of beleriand so many great prince and captain were assembled ,LOTR1,False
6457, and yet not so many nor so fair a when thangorodrim wa broken and the elve deemed that evil wa ended for ever and it wa not so ,LOTR1,False
6458, said frodo speaking hi thought aloud in hi astonishment ,LOTR1,False
6459, but i thought  he stammered a elrond turned toward him i thought that the fall of gil galad wa a long age ago ,LOTR1,False
6460, so it wa indeed  answered elrond gravely ,LOTR1,False
6461, but my memory reache back even to the elder day ,LOTR1,False
6462, edrendil wa my sire who wa born in gondolin before it fall; and my mother wa elwing daughter of dior son of lthien of doriath ,LOTR1,False
6463, i have seen three age in the west of the world and many defeat and many fruitl victorie ,LOTR1,False
6464, i wa the herald of gil galad and marched with hi host ,LOTR1,False
6465, i wa at the battle of dagorlad before the black gate of mordor where we had the mastery: for the spear of gil galad and the sword of elendil aiglo and narsil none could withstand ,LOTR1,False
6466, i beheld the last combat on the slope of orodruin where gil galad died and elendil fell and narsil broke beneath him; but sauron himself wa overthrown and isildur cut the ring from hi hand with the hilt shard of hi father sword and took it for hi own ,LOTR1,False
6467, at thi the stranger boromir broke in ,LOTR1,False
6468, so that i what became of the ring ,LOTR1,False
6469, if ever such a tale wa told in the south it ha long been forgotten ,LOTR1,False
6470, i have heard of the great ring of him that we do not name; but we believed that it perished from the world in the ruin of hi first realm ,LOTR1,False
6471, isildur took it a should not have been ,LOTR1,False
6472, it should have been cast then into orodruin fire nigh at hand where it wa made ,LOTR1,False
6473, but few marked what isildur did ,LOTR1,False
6474, he alone stood by hi father in that last mortal contest; and by gil galad only cnrdan stood and i ,LOTR1,False
6475, but isildur would not listen to our counsel ,LOTR1,False
6476,  thi i will have a weregild for my father and my brother he said; and therefore whether we would or no he took it to treasure it ,LOTR1,False
6477, but soon he wa betrayed by it to hi death; and so it i named in the north isildur bane ,LOTR1,False
6478, yet death maybe wa better than what else might have befallen him ,LOTR1,False
6479, only to the north did these tiding come and only to a few ,LOTR1,False
6480, small wonder it i that you have not heard them boromir ,LOTR1,False
6481, from the ruin of the gladden field where isildur perished three men only came ever back over the mountain after long wandering ,LOTR1,False
6482, one of these wa ohtar the esquire of isildur who bore the shard of the sword of elendil; and he brought them to valandil the heir of isildur who being but a child had remained here in rivendell ,LOTR1,False
6483, but narsil wa broken and it light extinguished and it ha not yet been forged again ,LOTR1,False
6484, fruitl did i call the victory of the fast alliance ,LOTR1,False
6485, not wholly so yet it did not achieve it end ,LOTR1,False
6486, sauron wa diminished but not destroyed ,LOTR1,False
6487, hi ring wa lost but not unmade ,LOTR1,False
6488, the dark tower wa broken but it foundation were not removed; for they were made with the power of the ring and while it remain they will endure ,LOTR1,False
6489, many elve and many mighty men and many of their friend had perished in the war ,LOTR1,False
6490, anbrion wa slain and isildur wa slain; and gil galad and elendil were no more ,LOTR1,False
6491, never again shall there be any such league of elve and men; for men multiply and the firstborn decrease and the two kindred are estranged ,LOTR1,False
6492, and ever since that day the race of nmenor ha decayed and the span of their year ha lessened ,LOTR1,False
6493, in the north after the war and the slaughter of the gladden field the men of westernesse were diminished and their city of annmina beside fake evendim fell into ruin; and the heir of valandil removed and dwelt at fornost on the high north down and that now too i desolate ,LOTR1,False
6494, men call it deadmen dike and they fear to tread there ,LOTR1,False
6495, for the folk of arnor dwindled and their foe devoured them and their lordship passed leaving only green mound in the grassy hill ,LOTR1,False
6496, in the south the realm of gondor long endured; and for a while it splendour grew recalling somewhat of the might of nmenor ere it fell ,LOTR1,False
6497, high tower that people built and strong place and haven of many ships; and the winged crown of the king of men wa held in awe by folk of many tongue ,LOTR1,False
6498, their chief city wa osgiliath citadel of the star through the midst of which the river flowed ,LOTR1,False
6499, and mina ithil they built tower of the rising moon eastward upon a shoulder of the mountain of shadow; and westward at the feet of the white mountain mina anor they made tower of the setting sun ,LOTR1,False
6500, there in the court of the king grew a white tree from the seed of that tree which isildur brought over the deep water and the seed of that tree before came from eressla and before that out of the uttermost west in the day before day when the world wa young ,LOTR1,False
6501, but in the wearing of the swift year of middle earth the line of meneldil son of anbrion failed and the tree withered and the blood of the nmenorean became mingled with that of lesser men ,LOTR1,False
6502, then the watch upon the wall of mordor slept and dark thing crept back to gorgoroth ,LOTR1,False
6503, and on a time evil thing came forth and they took mina ithil and abode in it and they made it into a place of dread; and it i called mina morgul the tower of sorcery ,LOTR1,False
6504, then mina anor wa named anew mina tirith the tower of guard; and these two citie were ever at war but osgiliath which lay between wa deserted and in it ruin shadow walked ,LOTR1,False
6505, so it ha been for many live of men ,LOTR1,False
6506, but the lord of mina tirith still fight on defying our enemie keeping the passage of the river from argonath to the sea ,LOTR1,False
6507, and now that part of the tale that i shall tell i drawn to it close ,LOTR1,False
6508, for in the day of isildur the ruling ring passed out of all knowledge and the three were released from it dominion ,LOTR1,False
6509, but now in thi latter day they are in peril once more for to our sorrow the one ha been found ,LOTR1,False
6510, other shall speak of it finding for in that i played small part ,LOTR1,False
6511, he ceased but at once boromir stood up tall and proud before them ,LOTR1,False
6512, give me leave master elrond said he first to say more of gondor; for verily from the land of gondor i am come ,LOTR1,False
6513, and it would be well for all to know what passe there ,LOTR1,False
6514, for few i deem know of our deed and therefore gu little of their peril if we should fail at last ,LOTR1,False
6515, believe not that in the land of gondor the blood of nmenor i spent nor all it pride and dignity forgotten ,LOTR1,False
6516, by our valour the wild folk of the east are still restrained and the terror of morgul kept at bay; and thu alone are peace and freedom maintained in the land behind u bulwark of the west ,LOTR1,False
6517, but if the passage of the river should be won what then ,LOTR1,False
6518, yet that hour maybe i not now far away ,LOTR1,False
6519, the namel enemy ha arisen again ,LOTR1,False
6520, smoke rise once more from orodruin that we call mount doom ,LOTR1,False
6521, the power of the black land grow and we are hard beset ,LOTR1,False
6522, when the enemy returned our folk were driven from ithilien our fair domain east of the river though we kept a foothold there and strength of arm but thi very year in the day of june sudden war came upon u out of mordor and we were swept away ,LOTR1,False
6523, we were outnumbered for mordor ha allied itself with the easterling and the cruel elaradrim; but it wa not by number that we were defeated ,LOTR1,False
6524, a power wa there that we have not felt before ,LOTR1,False
6525, some said that it could be seen like a great black horseman a dark shadow under the moon ,LOTR1,False
6526, wherever he came a madn filled our foe but fear fell on our boldest so that horse and man gave way and fled ,LOTR1,False
6527, only a remnant of our eastern force came back destroying the last bridge that still stood amid the ruin of osgiliath ,LOTR1,False
6528, i wa in the company that held the bridge until it wa cast down behind u ,LOTR1,False
6529, four only were saved by swimming: my brother and myself and two other ,LOTR1,False
6530, but still we fight on holding all the west shore of anduin; and those who shelter behind u give u praise if ever they hear our name: much praise but little help ,LOTR1,False
6531, only from rohan now will any men ride to u when we call ,LOTR1,False
6532, in thi evil hour i have come on an errand over many dangerou league to elrond: a hundred and ten day i have journeyed all alone ,LOTR1,False
6533, but i do not seek allie in war ,LOTR1,False
6534, the might of elrond i in wisdom not in weapon it i said ,LOTR1,False
6535, i come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard word ,LOTR1,False
6536, for on the eve of the sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled sleep; and afterward a like dream came oft to him again and once to me ,LOTR1,False
6537, in that dream i thought the eastern sky grew dark and there wa a growing thunder but in the west a pale light lingered and out of it i heard a voice remote but clear crying: seek for the sword that wa broken: in imladri it dwells; there shall be counsel taken stronger than morgul spell ,LOTR1,False
6538, there shall be shown a token that doom i near at hand for isildur bane shall waken and the halfling forth shall stand ,LOTR1,False
6539, of these word we could understand little and we spoke to our father denethor lord of mina tirith wise in the lore of gondor ,LOTR1,False
6540, thi only would he say that imladri wa of old the name among the elve of a far northern dale where elrond the halfelven dwelt greatest of lore master ,LOTR1,False
6541, therefore my brother seeing how desperate wa our need wa eager to heed the dream and seek for imladris; but since the way wa full of doubt and danger i took the journey upon myself ,LOTR1,False
6542, loth wa my father to give me leave and long have i wandered by road forgotten seeking the house of elrond of which many had heard but few knew where it lay ,LOTR1,False
6543, and here in the house of elrond more shall be made clear to you said aragorn standing up ,LOTR1,False
6544, he cast hi sword upon the table that stood before elrond and the blade wa in two piece ,LOTR1,False
6545, here i the sword that wa broken ,LOTR1,False
6546, and who are you and what have you to do with mina tirith ,LOTR1,False
6547, asked boromir looking in wonder at the lean face of the ranger and hi weather stained cloak ,LOTR1,False
6548, he i aragorn son of arathorn  said elrond; and he i descended through many father from isildur elendil son of mina ithil ,LOTR1,False
6549, he i the chief of the dnedain in the north and few are now left of that folk ,LOTR1,False
6550, then it belong to you and not to me at all ,LOTR1,False
6551, cried frodo in amazement springing to hi feet a if he expected the ring to be demanded at once ,LOTR1,False
6552, it doe not belong to either of u  said aragorn; but it ha been ordained that you should hold it for a while ,LOTR1,False
6553, bring out the ring frodo ,LOTR1,False
6554, hold it up and then boromir will understand the remainder of hi riddle ,LOTR1,False
6555, there wa a hush and all turned their eye on frodo ,LOTR1,False
6556, he wa shaken by a sudden shame and fear; and he felt a great reluctance to reveal the ring and a loathing of it touch ,LOTR1,False
6557, he wished he wa far away ,LOTR1,False
6558, the ring gleamed and flickered a he held it up before them in hi trembling hand ,LOTR1,False
6559, boromir eye glinted a he gazed at the golden thing ,LOTR1,False
6560, i then the doom of mina tirith come at last ,LOTR1,False
6561, but why then should we seek a broken sword ,LOTR1,False
6562, the word were not the doom of mina tirith  said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
6563, but doom and great deed are indeed at hand ,LOTR1,False
6564, for the sword that wa broken i the sword of elendil that broke beneath him when he fell ,LOTR1,False
6565, it ha been treasured by hi heir when all other heirloom were lost; for it wa spoken of old among u that it should be made again when the ring isildur bane wa found ,LOTR1,False
6566, now you have seen the sword that you have sought what would you ask ,LOTR1,False
6567, do you wish for the house of elendil to return to the land of gondor ,LOTR1,False
6568, i wa not sent to beg any boon but to seek only the meaning of a riddle  answered boromir proudly ,LOTR1,False
6569, yet we are hard pressed and the sword of elendil would be a help beyond our hope if such a thing could indeed return out of the shadow of the past ,LOTR1,False
6570, he looked again at aragorn and doubt wa in hi eye ,LOTR1,False
6571, frodo felt bilbo stir impatiently at hi side ,LOTR1,False
6572, evidently he wa annoyed on hi friend behalf ,LOTR1,False
6573, standing suddenly up he burst out: all that i gold doe not glitter not all those who wander are lost; the old that i strong doe not wither deep root are not reached by the frost ,LOTR1,False
6574, from the ashe a fire shall be woken a light from the shadow shall spring; renewed shall be blade that wa broken: the crownl again shall be king ,LOTR1,False
6575, not very good perhap but to the point if you need more beyond the word of elrond ,LOTR1,False
6576, if that wa worth a journey of a hundred and ten day to hear you had best listen to it ,LOTR1,False
6577, he sat down with a snort ,LOTR1,False
6578, i made that up myself  he whispered to frodo for the dnadan a long time ago when he first told me about himself ,LOTR1,False
6579, i almost wish that my adventure were not over and that i could go with him when hi day come ,LOTR1,False
6580, aragorn smiled at him; then he turned to boromir again ,LOTR1,False
6581, for my part i forgive your doubt  he said ,LOTR1,False
6582, little do i resemble the figure of elendil and isildur a they stand carven in their majesty in the hall of denethor ,LOTR1,False
6583, i am but the heir of isildur not isildur himself ,LOTR1,False
6584, i have had a hard life and a long; and the league that lie between here and gondor are a small part in the count of my journey ,LOTR1,False
6585, i have crossed many mountain and many river and trodden many plain even into the far countrie of rhyn and harad where the star are strange ,LOTR1,False
6586, but my home such a i have i in the north ,LOTR1,False
6587, for here the heir of valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many generation ,LOTR1,False
6588, our day have darkened and we have dwindled; but ever the sword ha passed to a new keeper ,LOTR1,False
6589, and thi i will say to you boromir ere i end ,LOTR1,False
6590, lonely men are we ranger of the wild hunters but hunter ever of the servant of the enemy; for they are found in many place not in mordor only ,LOTR1,False
6591, if gondor boromir ha been a stalwart tower we have played another part ,LOTR1,False
6592, many evil thing there are that your strong wall and bright sword do not stay ,LOTR1,False
6593, you know little of the land beyond your bound ,LOTR1,False
6594, peace and freedom do you say ,LOTR1,False
6595, the north would have known them little but for u ,LOTR1,False
6596, fear would have destroyed them ,LOTR1,False
6597, but when dark thing come from the housel hill or creep from sunl wood they fly from u ,LOTR1,False
6598, what road would any dare to tread what safety would there be in quiet land or in the home of simple men at night if the dnedain were asleep or were all gone into the grave ,LOTR1,False
6599, and yet l thank have we than you ,LOTR1,False
6600, traveller scowl at u and countrymen give u scornful name ,LOTR1,False
6601, strider i am to one fat man who live within a day march of foe that would freeze hi heart or lay hi little town in ruin if he were not guarded ceaselessly ,LOTR1,False
6602, yet we would not have it otherwise ,LOTR1,False
6603, if simple folk are free from care and fear simple they will be and we must be secret to keep them so ,LOTR1,False
6604, that ha been the task of my kindred while the year have lengthened and the gras ha grown ,LOTR1,False
6605, but now the world i changing once again ,LOTR1,False
6606, the sword shall be reforged ,LOTR1,False
6607, i will come to mina tirith ,LOTR1,False
6608, isildur bane i found you say  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
6609, i have seen a bright ring in the halfling hand; but isildur perished ere thi age of the world began they say ,LOTR1,False
6610, how do the wise know that thi ring i his ,LOTR1,False
6611, and how ha it passed down the year until it i brought hither by so strange a messenger ,LOTR1,False
6612, that shall be told  said elrond ,LOTR1,False
6613, but not yet i beg master ,LOTR1,False
6614, already the sun i climbing to noon and i feel the need of something to strengthen me ,LOTR1,False
6615, i had not named you  said elrond smiling ,LOTR1,False
6616, but i do so now ,LOTR1,False
6617, and if you have not yet cast your story into verse you may tell it in plain word ,LOTR1,False
6618, the briefer the sooner shall you be refreshed ,LOTR1,False
6619, very well  said bilbo ,LOTR1,False
6620, i will do a you bid ,LOTR1,False
6621, but i will now tell the true story and if some here have heard me tell it otherwise he looked sidelong at gluin l ask them to forget it and forgive me ,LOTR1,False
6622, i only wished to claim the treasure a my very own in those day and to be rid of the name of thief that wa put on me ,LOTR1,False
6623, but perhap i understand thing a little better now ,LOTR1,False
6624, anyway thi i what happened ,LOTR1,False
6625, to some there bilbo tale wa wholly new and they listened with amazement while the old hobbit actually not at all displeased recounted hi adventure with gollum at full length ,LOTR1,False
6626, he did not omit a single riddle ,LOTR1,False
6627, he would have given also an account of hi party and disappearance from the shire if he had been allowed; but elrond raised hi hand ,LOTR1,False
6628, well told my friend  he said but that i enough at thi time ,LOTR1,False
6629, for the moment it suffice to know that the ring passed to frodo your heir ,LOTR1,False
6630, then l willingly than bilbo frodo told of all hi dealing with the ring from the day that it passed into hi keeping ,LOTR1,False
6631, every step of hi journey from hobbiton to the ford of bruinen wa questioned and considered and everything that he could recall concerning the black rider wa examined ,LOTR1,False
6632, at last he sat down again ,LOTR1,False
6633, not bad  bilbo said to him ,LOTR1,False
6634, you would have made a good story of it if they hadnt kept on interrupting ,LOTR1,False
6635, i tried to make a few note but we shall have to go over it all again together some time if i am to write it up ,LOTR1,False
6636, there are whole chapter of stuff before you ever got here ,LOTR1,False
6637, ye it made quite a long tale  answered frodo ,LOTR1,False
6638, but the story still doe not seem complete to me ,LOTR1,False
6639, i still want to know a good deal especially about gandalf ,LOTR1,False
6640, galdor of the haven who sat near by overheard him ,LOTR1,False
6641, you speak for me also  he cried and turning to elrond he said: the wise may have good reason to believe that the halfling trove i indeed the great ring of long debate unlikely though that may seem to those who know l ,LOTR1,False
6642, but may we not hear the proofs ,LOTR1,False
6643, and i would ask thi also ,LOTR1,False
6644, he i learned in the lore of the ring yet he i not among u ,LOTR1,False
6645, what i hi counsel if he know the thing that we have heard ,LOTR1,False
6646, the question that you ask galdor are bound together  said elrond ,LOTR1,False
6647, i had not overlooked them and they shall be answered ,LOTR1,False
6648, but these thing it i the part of gandalf to make clear; and i call upon him last for it i the place of honour and in all thi matter he ha been the chief ,LOTR1,False
6649, some galdor  said gandalf would think the tiding of gluin and the pursuit of frodo proof enough that the halfling trove i a thing of great worth to the enemy ,LOTR1,False
6650, yet it i a ring ,LOTR1,False
6651, the nine the nazgyl keep ,LOTR1,False
6652, the seven are taken or destroyed ,LOTR1,False
6653, at thi gluin stirred but did not speak ,LOTR1,False
6654, the three we know of ,LOTR1,False
6655, what then i thi one that he desire so much ,LOTR1,False
6656, there i indeed a wide waste of time between the river and the mountain between the los and the finding ,LOTR1,False
6657, but the gap in the knowledge of the wise ha been filled at last ,LOTR1,False
6658, for the enemy ha been close behind closer even than i feared ,LOTR1,False
6659, and well i it that not until thi year thi very summer a it seem did he learn the full truth ,LOTR1,False
6660, some here will remember that many year ago i myself dared to pas the door of the necromancer in dol guldur and secretly explored hi way and found thu that our fear were true: he wa none other than sauron our enemy of old at length taking shape and power again ,LOTR1,False
6661, some too will remember also that saruman dissuaded u from open deed against him and for long we watched him only ,LOTR1,False
6662, yet at last a hi shadow grew saruman yielded and the council put forth it strength and drove the evil out of mirkwood and that wa in the very year of the finding of thi ring: a strange chance if chance it wa ,LOTR1,False
6663, but we were too late a elrond foresaw ,LOTR1,False
6664, sauron also had watched u and had long prepared against our stroke governing mordor from afar through mina morgul where hi nine servant dwelt until all wa ready ,LOTR1,False
6665, then he gave way before u but only feigned to flee and soon after came to the dark tower and openly declared himself ,LOTR1,False
6666, then for the last time the council met; for now we learned that he wa seeking ever more eagerly for the one ,LOTR1,False
6667, we feared then that he had some new of it that we knew nothing of ,LOTR1,False
6668, but saruman said nay and repeated what he had said to u before: that the one would never again be found in middle earth ,LOTR1,False
6669, at the worst said he our enemy know that we have it not and that it still i lost ,LOTR1,False
6670, but what wa lost may yet be found he think ,LOTR1,False
6671, hi hope will cheat him ,LOTR1,False
6672, have i not earnestly studied thi matter ,LOTR1,False
6673, into anduin the great it fell; and long ago while sauron slept it wa rolled down the river to the sea ,LOTR1,False
6674, there let it lie until the end ,LOTR1,False
6675, gandalf fell silent gazing eastward from the porch to the far peak of the misty mountain at whose great root the peril of the world had so long lain hidden ,LOTR1,False
6676, there i wa at fault  he said ,LOTR1,False
6677, i wa lulled by the word of saruman the wise; but i should have sought for the truth sooner and our peril would now be l ,LOTR1,False
6678, we were all at fault  said elrond and but for your vigilance the darkn maybe would already be upon u ,LOTR1,False
6679, from the first my heart misgave me against all reason that i knew  said gandalf and i desired to know how thi thing came to gollum and how long he had possessed it ,LOTR1,False
6680, so i set a watch for him guessing that he would ere long come forth from hi darkn to seek for hi treasure ,LOTR1,False
6681, he came but he escaped and wa not found ,LOTR1,False
6682, i let the matter rest watching and waiting only a we have too often done ,LOTR1,False
6683, time passed with many care until my doubt were awakened again to sudden fear ,LOTR1,False
6684, whence came the hobbit ring ,LOTR1,False
6685, what if my fear wa true should be done with it ,LOTR1,False
6686, those thing i must decide ,LOTR1,False
6687, but i spoke yet of my dread to none knowing the peril of an untimely whisper if it went astray ,LOTR1,False
6688, in all the long war with the dark tower treason ha ever been our greatest foe ,LOTR1,False
6689, that wa seventeen year ago ,LOTR1,False
6690, soon i became aware that spie of many sort even beast and bird were gathered round the shire and my fear grew ,LOTR1,False
6691, i called for the help of the dnedain and their watch wa doubled; and i opened my heart to aragorn the heir of isildur ,LOTR1,False
6692, and i  said aragorn counselled that we should hunt for gollum ,LOTR1,False
6693, too late though it may seem ,LOTR1,False
6694, and since it seemed fit that isildur heir should labour to repair isildur fault i went with gandalf on the long and hopel search ,LOTR1,False
6695, then gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of wilderland down even to the mountain of shadow and the fence of mordor ,LOTR1,False
6696, there we had rumour of him and we gu that he dwelt there long in the dark hills; but we never found him and at last i despaired ,LOTR1,False
6697, and then in my despair i thought again of a test that might make the finding of gollum unneeded ,LOTR1,False
6698, the ring itself might tell if it were the one ,LOTR1,False
6699, the memory of word at the council came back to me: word of saruman half heeded at the time ,LOTR1,False
6700, i heard them now clearly in my heart ,LOTR1,False
6701,  the nine the seven and the three he said had each their proper gem ,LOTR1,False
6702, it wa round and unadorned a it were one of the lesser rings; but it maker set mark upon it that the skilled maybe could still see and read ,LOTR1,False
6703, what those mark were he had not said ,LOTR1,False
6704, but great though hi lore may be it must have a source ,LOTR1,False
6705, what hand save sauron ever held thi thing ere it wa lost ,LOTR1,False
6706, the hand of isildur alone ,LOTR1,False
6707, with that thought i forsook the chase and passed swiftly to gondor ,LOTR1,False
6708, in former day the member of my order had been well received there but saruman most of all ,LOTR1,False
6709, often he had been for long the guest of the lord of the city ,LOTR1,False
6710, l welcome did the lord denethor show me then than of old and grudgingly he permitted me to search among hi hoarded scroll and book ,LOTR1,False
6711,  if indeed you look only a you say for record of ancient day and the beginning of the city read on ,LOTR1,False
6712, for to me what wa i l dark than what i to come and that i my care ,LOTR1,False
6713, but unl you have more skill even than saruman who ha studied here long you will find naught that i not well known to me who am master of the lore of thi city ,LOTR1,False
6714, and yet there lie in hi hoard many record that few now can read even of the lore master for their script and tongue have become dark to later men ,LOTR1,False
6715, and boromir there lie in mina tirith still unread i gu by any save saruman and myself since the king failed a scroll that isildur made himself ,LOTR1,False
6716, for isildur did not march away straight from the war in mordor a some have told the tale ,LOTR1,False
6717, some in the north maybe  boromir broke in ,LOTR1,False
6718, all know in gondor that he went first to mina anor and dwelt a while with hi nephew meneldil instructing him before he committed to him the rule of the south kingdom ,LOTR1,False
6719, in that time he planted there the last sapling of the white tree in memory of hi brother ,LOTR1,False
6720, but in that time also he made thi scroll  said gandalf; and that i not remembered in gondor it would seem ,LOTR1,False
6721, for thi scroll concern the ring and thu wrote isildur therein: the great ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the north kingdom; but record of it shall be left in gondor where also dwell the heir of elendil lest a time come when the memory of these great matter shall grow dim ,LOTR1,False
6722, and after these word isildur described the ring such a he found it ,LOTR1,False
6723, it wa hot when i first took it hot a a glede and my hand wa scorched so that i doubt if ever again i shall be free of the pain of it ,LOTR1,False
6724, yet even a i write it i cooled and it seemeth to shrink though it loseth neither it beauty nor it shape ,LOTR1,False
6725, already the writing upon it which at first wa a clear a red flame fadeth and i now only barely to be read ,LOTR1,False
6726, it i fashioned in an elven script of eregion for they have no letter in mordor for such subtle work; but the language i unknown to me ,LOTR1,False
6727, i deem it to be a tongue of the black land since it i foul and uncouth ,LOTR1,False
6728, what evil it saith i do not know; but i trace here a copy of it lest it fade beyond recall ,LOTR1,False
6729, the ring misseth maybe the heat of sauron hand which wa black and yet burned like fire and so gil galad wa destroyed; and maybe were the gold made hot again the writing would be refreshed gut for my part i will risk no hurt to thi thing: of all the work of sauron the only fair ,LOTR1,False
6730, it i preciou to me though i buy it with great pain ,LOTR1,False
6731, when i read these word my quest wa ended ,LOTR1,False
6732, for the traced writing wa indeed a isildur guessed in the tongue of mordor and the servant of the tower ,LOTR1,False
6733, and what wa said therein wa already known ,LOTR1,False
6734, for in the day that sauron first put on the one celebrimbor maker of the three wa aware of him and from afar he heard him speak these word and so hi evil purpose were revealed ,LOTR1,False
6735, at once i took my leave of denethor but even a i went northward message came to me out of lurien that aragorn had passed that way and that he had found the creature called gollum ,LOTR1,False
6736, therefore i went first to meet him and hear hi tale ,LOTR1,False
6737, into what deadly peril he had gone alone i dared not gu ,LOTR1,False
6738, there i little need to tell of them  said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
6739, if a man must need walk in sight of the black gate or tread the deadly flower of morgul vale then peril he will have ,LOTR1,False
6740, i too despaired at last and i began my homeward journey ,LOTR1,False
6741, and then by fortune i came suddenly on what i sought: the mark of soft feet beside a muddy pool ,LOTR1,False
6742, but now the trail wa fresh and swift and it led not to mordor but away ,LOTR1,False
6743, along the skirt of the dead marshe i followed it and then i had him ,LOTR1,False
6744, lurking by a stagnant mere peering in the water a the dark eve fell i caught him gollum ,LOTR1,False
6745, he wa covered with green slime ,LOTR1,False
6746, he will never love me i fear; for he bit me and i wa not gentle ,LOTR1,False
6747, nothing more did i ever get from hi mouth than the mark of hi teeth ,LOTR1,False
6748, i deemed it the worst part of all my journey the road back watching him day and night making him walk before me with a halter on hi neck gagged until he wa tamed by lack of drink and food driving him ever toward mirkwood ,LOTR1,False
6749, i brought him there at last and gave him to the elve for we had agreed that thi should be done; and i wa glad to be rid of hi company for he stank ,LOTR1,False
6750, for my part i hope never to look upon him again; but gandalf came and endured long speech with him ,LOTR1,False
6751, ye long and weary  said gandalf but not without profit ,LOTR1,False
6752, for one thing the tale he told of hi los agreed with that which bilbo ha now told openly for the first time; but that mattered little since i had already guessed it ,LOTR1,False
6753, but i learned then first that gollum ring came out of the great river nigh to the gladden field ,LOTR1,False
6754, and i learned also that he had possessed it long ,LOTR1,False
6755, many live of hi small kind ,LOTR1,False
6756, the power of the ring had lengthened hi year far beyond their span; but that power only the great ring wield ,LOTR1,False
6757, and if that i not proof enough galdor there i the other test that i spoke of ,LOTR1,False
6758, upon thi very ring which you have here seen held aloft round and unadorned the letter that isildur reported may still be read if one ha the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while ,LOTR1,False
6759, that i have done and thi i have read: ash nazg durbatulyk ush nazg gimbatul ash nazg thrakatulyk agh burzum ishi krimpatul ,LOTR1,False
6760,  the change in the wizard voice wa astounding ,LOTR1,False
6761, suddenly it became menacing powerful harsh a stone ,LOTR1,False
6762, a shadow seemed to pas over the high sun and the porch for a moment grew dark ,LOTR1,False
6763, all trembled and the elve stopped their ear ,LOTR1,False
6764, never before ha any voice dared to utter the word of that tongue in imladri gandalf the grey  said elrond a the shadow passed and the company breathed once more ,LOTR1,False
6765, and let u hope that none will ever speak it here again  answered gandalf ,LOTR1,False
6766, nonethel i do not ask your pardon master elrond ,LOTR1,False
6767, for if that tongue i not soon to be heard in every corner of the west then let all put doubt aside that thi thing i indeed what the wise have declared: the treasure of the enemy fraught with all hi malice; and in it lie a great part of hi strength of old ,LOTR1,False
6768, out of the black year come the word that the smith of eregion heard and knew that they had been betrayed: one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkn bind them ,LOTR1,False
6769, know also my friend that i learned more yet from gollum ,LOTR1,False
6770, he wa loth to speak and hi tale wa unclear but it i beyond all doubt that he went to mordor and there all that he knew wa forced from him ,LOTR1,False
6771, thu the enemy know now that the one i found that it wa long in the shire; and since hi servant have pursued it almost to our door he soon will know already he may know even a i speak that we have it here ,LOTR1,False
6772, all sat silent for a while until at length boromir spoke ,LOTR1,False
6773, he i a small thing you say thi gollum ,LOTR1,False
6774, small but great in mischief ,LOTR1,False
6775, to what doom did you put him ,LOTR1,False
6776, he i in prison but no worse  said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
6777, there i no doubt that he wa tormented and the fear of sauron lie black on hi heart ,LOTR1,False
6778, still i for one am glad that he i safely kept by the watchful elve of mirkwood ,LOTR1,False
6779, hi malice i great and give him a strength hardly to be believed in one so lean and withered ,LOTR1,False
6780, he could work much mischief still if he were free ,LOTR1,False
6781, and i do not doubt that he wa allowed to leave mordor on some evil errand ,LOTR1,False
6782, cried legola and in hi fair elvish face there wa great distr ,LOTR1,False
6783, the tiding that i wa sent to bring must now be told ,LOTR1,False
6784, they are not good but only here have i learned how evil they may seem to thi company ,LOTR1,False
6785, smjagol who i now called gollum ha escaped ,LOTR1,False
6786, that i ill new indeed ,LOTR1,False
6787, we shall all rue it bitterly i fear ,LOTR1,False
6788, how came the folk of thranduil to fail in their trust ,LOTR1,False
6789, not through lack of watchfuln  said legolas; but perhap through over kindlin ,LOTR1,False
6790, and we fear that the prisoner had aid from other and that more i known of our doing than we could wish ,LOTR1,False
6791, we guarded thi creature day and night at gandalf bidding much though we wearied of the task ,LOTR1,False
6792, but gandalf bade u hope still for hi cure and we had not the heart to keep him ever in dungeon under the earth where he would fall back into hi old black thought ,LOTR1,False
6793, you were l tender to me  said gluin with a flash of hi eye a old memorie were stirred of hi imprisonment in the deep place of the elven king hall ,LOTR1,False
6794, pray do not interrupt my good gluin ,LOTR1,False
6795, that wa a regrettable misunderstanding long set right ,LOTR1,False
6796, if all the grievance that stand between elve and dwarve are to be brought up here we may a well abandon thi council ,LOTR1,False
6797, gluin rose and bowed and legola continued ,LOTR1,False
6798, in the day of fair weather we led gollum through the woods; and there wa a high tree standing alone far from the other which he liked to climb ,LOTR1,False
6799, often we let him mount up to the highest branche until he felt the free wind; but we set a guard at the tree foot ,LOTR1,False
6800, one day he refused to come down and the guard had no mind to climb after him: he had learned the trick of clinging to bough with hi feet a well a with hi hands; so they sat by the tree far into the night ,LOTR1,False
6801, it wa that very night of summer yet moonl and starl that ore came on u at unaware ,LOTR1,False
6802, we drove them off after some time; they were many and fierce but they came from over the mountain and were unused to the wood ,LOTR1,False
6803, when the battle wa over we found that gollum wa gone and hi guard were slain or taken ,LOTR1,False
6804, it then seemed plain to u that the attack had been made for hi rescue and that he knew of it beforehand ,LOTR1,False
6805, how that wa contrived we cannot guess; but gollum i cunning and the spie of the enemy are many ,LOTR1,False
6806, the dark thing that were driven out in the year of the dragon fall have returned in greater number and mirkwood i again an evil place save where our realm i maintained ,LOTR1,False
6807, we have failed to recapture gollum ,LOTR1,False
6808, we came on hi trail among those of many ore and it plunged deep into the forest going south ,LOTR1,False
6809, but ere long it escaped our skill and we dared not continue the hunt; for we were drawing nigh to dol guldur and that i still a very evil place; we do not go that way ,LOTR1,False
6810, well well he i gone  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
6811, we have no time to seek for him again ,LOTR1,False
6812, he must do what he will ,LOTR1,False
6813, but he may play a part yet that neither he nor sauron have foreseen ,LOTR1,False
6814, and now i will answer galdor other question ,LOTR1,False
6815, what are hi counsel to u in thi need ,LOTR1,False
6816, thi tale i must tell in full for only elrond ha heard it yet and that in brief but it will bear on all that we must resolve ,LOTR1,False
6817, it i the last chapter in the tale of the ring so far a it ha yet gone ,LOTR1,False
6818, at the end of june i wa in the shire but a cloud of anxiety wa on my mind and i rode to the southern border of the little land; for i had a foreboding of some danger still hidden from me but drawing near ,LOTR1,False
6819, there message reached me telling me of war and defeat in gondor and when i heard of the black shadow a chill smote my heart ,LOTR1,False
6820, but i found nothing save a few fugitive from the south; yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of which they would not speak ,LOTR1,False
6821, i turned then east and north and journeyed along the greenway; and not far from bree i came upon a traveller sitting on a bank beside the road with hi grazing horse beside him ,LOTR1,False
6822, it wa radagast the brown who at one time dwelt at rhosgobel near the border of mirkwood ,LOTR1,False
6823, he i one of my order but i had not seen him for many a year ,LOTR1,False
6824, but i am a stranger in these part ,LOTR1,False
6825, all i knew wa that you might be found in a wild region with the uncouth name of shire ,LOTR1,False
6826,  your information wa correct i said ,LOTR1,False
6827, but do not put it that way if you meet any of the inhabitant ,LOTR1,False
6828, you are near the border of the shire now ,LOTR1,False
6829, and what do you want with me ,LOTR1,False
6830, you were never a traveller unl driven by great need ,LOTR1,False
6831,  i have an urgent errand he said ,LOTR1,False
6832, then he looked about him a if the hedge might have ear ,LOTR1,False
6833, the nine are abroad again ,LOTR1,False
6834, they have crossed the river secretly and are moving westward ,LOTR1,False
6835, they have taken the guise of rider in black ,LOTR1,False
6836, i knew then what i had dreaded without knowing it ,LOTR1,False
6837, the enemy must have some great need or purpose said radagast; but what it i that make him look to these distant and desolate part i cannot gu ,LOTR1,False
6838, v what do you mean ,LOTR1,False
6839, v i have been told that wherever they go the rider ask for new of a land called shire ,LOTR1,False
6840,  the shire i said; but my heart sank ,LOTR1,False
6841, for even the wise might fear to withstand the nine when they are gathered together under their fell chieftain ,LOTR1,False
6842, a great king and sorcerer he wa of old and now he wield a deadly fear ,LOTR1,False
6843, who told you and who sent you ,LOTR1,False
6844,  saruman the white answered radagast ,LOTR1,False
6845, and he told me to say that if you feel the need he will help; but you must seek hi aid at once or it will be too late ,LOTR1,False
6846, and that message brought me hope ,LOTR1,False
6847, for saruman the white i the greatest of my order ,LOTR1,False
6848, radagast i of course a worthy wizard a master of shape and change of hue; and he ha much lore of herb and beast and bird are especially hi friend ,LOTR1,False
6849, but saruman ha long studied the art of the enemy himself and thu we have often been able to forestall him ,LOTR1,False
6850, it wa by the device of saruman that we drove him from dol guldur ,LOTR1,False
6851, it might be that he had found some weapon that would drive back the nine ,LOTR1,False
6852,  i will go to saruman i said ,LOTR1,False
6853,  then you must go now said radagast; for i have wasted time in looking for you and the day are running short ,LOTR1,False
6854, i wa told to find you before midsummer and that i now here ,LOTR1,False
6855, even if you set out from thi spot you will hardly reach him before the nine discover the land that they seek ,LOTR1,False
6856, i myself shall turn back at once ,LOTR1,False
6857, and with that he mounted and would have ridden straight off ,LOTR1,False
6858, we shall need your help and the help of all thing that will give it ,LOTR1,False
6859, send out message to all the beast and bird that are your friend ,LOTR1,False
6860, tell them to bring new of anything that bear on thi matter to saruman and gandalf ,LOTR1,False
6861, let message be sent to orthanc ,LOTR1,False
6862, i will do that he said and rode off a if the nine were after him ,LOTR1,False
6863, i could not follow him then and there ,LOTR1,False
6864, i had ridden very far already that day and i wa a weary a my horse; and i needed to consider matter ,LOTR1,False
6865, i stayed the night in bree and decided that i had no time to return to the shire ,LOTR1,False
6866, never did i make a greater mistake ,LOTR1,False
6867, however i wrote a message to frodo and trusted to my friend the innkeeper to send it to him ,LOTR1,False
6868, i rode away at dawn; and i came at long last to the dwelling of saruman ,LOTR1,False
6869, that i far south in isengard in the end of the misty mountain not far from the gap of rohan ,LOTR1,False
6870, and boromir will tell you that that i a great open vale that lie between the misty mountain and the northmost foothill of ered nimrai the white mountain of hi home ,LOTR1,False
6871, but isengard i a circle of sheer rock that enclose a valley a with a wall and in the midst of that valley i a tower of stone called orthanc ,LOTR1,False
6872, it wa not made by saruman but by the men of nmenor long ago; and it i very tall and ha many secrets; yet it look not to be a work of craft ,LOTR1,False
6873, it cannot be reached save by passing the circle of isengard; and in that circle there i only one gate ,LOTR1,False
6874, late one evening i came to the gate like a great arch in the wall of rock; and it wa strongly guarded ,LOTR1,False
6875, but the keeper of the gate were on the watch for me and told me that saruman awaited me ,LOTR1,False
6876, i rode under the arch and the gate closed silently behind me and suddenly i wa afraid though i knew no reason for it ,LOTR1,False
6877, but i rode to the foot of orthanc and came to the stair of saruman and there he met me and led me up to hi high chamber ,LOTR1,False
6878, he wore a ring on hi finger ,LOTR1,False
6879, so you have come gandalf he said to me gravely; but in hi eye there seemed to be a white light a if a cold laughter wa in hi heart ,LOTR1,False
6880, v ye i have come i said ,LOTR1,False
6881, i have come for your aid saruman the white ,LOTR1,False
6882, and that title seemed to anger him ,LOTR1,False
6883,  have you indeed gandalf the grey l he scoffed ,LOTR1,False
6884, it ha seldom been heard of that gandalf the grey sought for aid one so cunning and so wise wandering about the land and concerning himself in every busin whether it belong to him or not ,LOTR1,False
6885, i looked at him and wondered ,LOTR1,False
6886, but if i am not deceived said i thing are now moving which will require the union of all our strength ,LOTR1,False
6887,  that may be so he said but the thought i late in coming to you ,LOTR1,False
6888, i wonder have you concealed from me the head of the council a matter of greatest import ,LOTR1,False
6889, what bring you now from your lurking place in the shire ,LOTR1,False
6890,  the nine have come forth again i answered ,LOTR1,False
6891, they have crossed the river ,LOTR1,False
6892, so radagast said to me ,LOTR1,False
6893, laughed saruman and he no longer concealed hi scorn ,LOTR1,False
6894, yet he had just the wit to play the part that i set him ,LOTR1,False
6895, for you have come and that wa all the purpose of my message ,LOTR1,False
6896, and here you will stay gandalf the grey and rest from journey ,LOTR1,False
6897, for i am saruman the wise saruman ring maker saruman of many colours ,LOTR1,False
6898, i looked then and saw that hi robe which had seemed white were not so but were woven of all colour and if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so that the eye wa bewildered ,LOTR1,False
6899,  i liked white better i said ,LOTR1,False
6900, it serve a a beginning ,LOTR1,False
6901, white cloth may be dyed ,LOTR1,False
6902, the white page can be overwritten; and the white light can be broken ,LOTR1,False
6903,  in which case it i no longer white said i ,LOTR1,False
6904, and he that break a thing to find out what it i ha left the path of wisdom ,LOTR1,False
6905,  you need not speak to me a to one of the fool that you take for friend said he ,LOTR1,False
6906, i have not brought you hither to be instructed by you but to give you a choice ,LOTR1,False
6907, he drew himself up then and began to declaim a if he were making a speech long rehearsed ,LOTR1,False
6908, the elder day are gone ,LOTR1,False
6909, the middle day are passing ,LOTR1,False
6910, the younger day are beginning ,LOTR1,False
6911, the time of the elve i over but our time i at hand: the world of men which we must rule ,LOTR1,False
6912, but we must have power power to order all thing a we will for that good which only the wise can see ,LOTR1,False
6913,  and listen gandalf my old friend and helper ,LOTR1,False
6914, he said coming near and speaking now in a softer voice ,LOTR1,False
6915, i said we for we it may be if you will join with me ,LOTR1,False
6916, a new power i rising ,LOTR1,False
6917, against it the old allie and policie will not avail u at all ,LOTR1,False
6918, there i no hope left in elve or dying nmenor ,LOTR1,False
6919, thi then i one choice before you ,LOTR1,False
6920, we may join with that power ,LOTR1,False
6921, it would be wise gandalf ,LOTR1,False
6922, there i hope that way ,LOTR1,False
6923, it victory i at hand; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it ,LOTR1,False
6924, a the power grow it proved friend will also grow; and the wise such a you and i may with patience come at last to direct it course to control it ,LOTR1,False
6925, we can bide our time we can keep our thought in our heart deploring maybe evil done by the way but approving the high and ultimate purpose: knowledge rule order; all the thing that we have so far striven in vain to accomplish hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friend ,LOTR1,False
6926, there need not be there would not be any real change in our design only in our mean ,LOTR1,False
6927,  saruman i said i have heard speeche of thi kind before but only in the mouth of emissarie sent from mordor to deceive the ignorant ,LOTR1,False
6928, i cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ear ,LOTR1,False
6929, he looked at me sidelong and paused a while considering ,LOTR1,False
6930, well i see that thi wise course doe not commend itself to you he said ,LOTR1,False
6931, not if some better way can be contrived ,LOTR1,False
6932, he came and laid hi long hand on my arm ,LOTR1,False
6933, if we could command that then the power would pas to u ,LOTR1,False
6934, that i in truth why i brought you here ,LOTR1,False
6935, for i have many eye in my service and i believe that you know where thi preciou thing now lie ,LOTR1,False
6936, or why do the nine ask for the shire and what i your busin there ,LOTR1,False
6937, a he said thi a lust which he could not conceal shone suddenly in hi eye ,LOTR1,False
6938,  saruman i said standing away from him only one hand at a time can wield the one and you know that well so do not trouble to say we ,LOTR1,False
6939, but i would not give it nay i would not give even new of it to you now that i learn your mind ,LOTR1,False
6940, you were head of the council but you have unmasked yourself at last ,LOTR1,False
6941, well the choice are it seem to submit to sauron or to yourself ,LOTR1,False
6942, have you other to offer ,LOTR1,False
6943, he wa cold now and perilou ,LOTR1,False
6944, i did not expect you to show wisdom even in your own behalf; but i gave you the chance of aiding me willingly and so saving yourself much trouble and pain ,LOTR1,False
6945, the third choice i to stay here until the end ,LOTR1,False
6946,  until you reveal to me where the one may be found ,LOTR1,False
6947, i may find mean to persuade you ,LOTR1,False
6948, or until it i found in your despite and the ruler ha time to turn to lighter matters: to devise say a fitting reward for the hindrance and insolence of gandalf the grey ,LOTR1,False
6949,  that may not prove to be one of the lighter matter said i ,LOTR1,False
6950, he laughed at me for my word were empty and he knew it ,LOTR1,False
6951, they took me and they set me alone on the pinnacle of orthanc in the place where saruman wa accustomed to watch the star ,LOTR1,False
6952, there i no descent save by a narrow stair of many thousand step and the valley below seem far away ,LOTR1,False
6953, i looked on it and saw that wherea it had once been green and fair it wa now filled with pit and forge ,LOTR1,False
6954, wolve and ore were housed in isengard for saruman wa mustering a great force on hi own account in rivalry of sauron and not in hi service yet ,LOTR1,False
6955, over all hi work a dark smoke hung and wrapped itself about the side of orthanc ,LOTR1,False
6956, i stood alone on an island in the clouds; and i had no chance of escape and my day were bitter ,LOTR1,False
6957, i wa pierced with cold and i had but little room in which to pace to and fro brooding on the coming of the rider to the north ,LOTR1,False
6958, that the nine had indeed arisen i felt assured apart from the word of saruman which might be lie ,LOTR1,False
6959, long ere i came to isengard i had heard tiding by the way that could not be mistaken ,LOTR1,False
6960, fear wa ever in my heart for my friend in the shire; but still i had some hope ,LOTR1,False
6961, i hoped that frodo had set forth at once a my letter had urged and that he had reached rivendell before the deadly pursuit began ,LOTR1,False
6962, and both my fear and my hope proved ill founded ,LOTR1,False
6963, for my hope wa founded on a fat man in bree; and my fear wa founded on the cunning of sauron ,LOTR1,False
6964, but fat men who sell ale have many call to answer; and the power of sauron i still l than fear make it ,LOTR1,False
6965, but in the circle of isengard trapped and alone it wa not easy to think that the hunter before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the shire far away ,LOTR1,False
6966, you were walking backward and forward ,LOTR1,False
6967, the moon shone in your hair ,LOTR1,False
6968, gandalf paused astonished and looked at him ,LOTR1,False
6969, it wa only a dream said frodo but it suddenly came back to me ,LOTR1,False
6970, i had quite forgotten it ,LOTR1,False
6971, it came some time ago; after i left the shire i think ,LOTR1,False
6972, then it wa late in coming  said gandalf a you will see ,LOTR1,False
6973, i wa in an evil plight ,LOTR1,False
6974, and those who know me will agree that i have seldom been in such need and do not bear such misfortune well ,LOTR1,False
6975, gandalf the grey caught like a fly in a spider treacherou web ,LOTR1,False
6976, yet even the most subtle spider may leave a weak thread ,LOTR1,False
6977, at first i feared a saruman no doubt intended that radagast had also fallen ,LOTR1,False
6978, yet i had caught no hint of anything wrong in hi voice or in hi eye at our meeting ,LOTR1,False
6979, if i had i should never have gone to isengard or i should have gone more warily ,LOTR1,False
6980, so saruman guessed and he had concealed hi mind and deceived hi messenger ,LOTR1,False
6981, it would have been usel in any case to try and win over the honest radagast to treachery ,LOTR1,False
6982, he sought me in good faith and so persuaded me ,LOTR1,False
6983, that wa the undoing of saruman plot ,LOTR1,False
6984, for radagast knew no reason why he should not do a i asked; and he rode away toward mirkwood where he had many friend of old ,LOTR1,False
6985, and the eagle of the mountain went far and wide and they saw many things: the gathering of wolve and the mustering of ores; and the nine rider going hither and thither in the lands; and they heard new of the escape of gollum ,LOTR1,False
6986, and they sent a messenger to bring these tiding to me ,LOTR1,False
6987, so it wa that when summer waned there came a night of moon and gwaihir the windlord swiftest of the great eagle came unlooked for to orthanc; and he found me standing on the pinnacle ,LOTR1,False
6988, then i spoke to him and he bore me away before saruman wa aware ,LOTR1,False
6989, i wa far from isengard ere the wolve and ore issued from the gate to pursue me ,LOTR1,False
6990,  how far can you bear me ,LOTR1,False
6991,  many league said he but not to the end of the earth ,LOTR1,False
6992, i wa sent to bear tiding not burden ,LOTR1,False
6993,  then i must have a steed on land i said and a steed surpassingly swift for i have never had such need of haste before ,LOTR1,False
6994,  then i will bear you to edora where the lord of rohan sit in hi hall he said; for that i not very far off ,LOTR1,False
6995, and i wa glad for in the riddermark of rohan the rohirrim the horse lord dwell and there are no horse like those that are bred in that great vale between the misty mountain and the white ,LOTR1,False
6996,  are the men of rohan still to be trusted do you think ,LOTR1,False
6997, i said to gwaihir for the treason of saruman had shaken my faith ,LOTR1,False
6998,  they pay a tribute of horse he answered and send many yearly to mordor or so it i said; but they are not yet under the yoke ,LOTR1,False
6999, but if saruman ha become evil a you say then their doom cannot be long delayed ,LOTR1,False
7000, he set me down in the land of rohan ere dawn; and now i have lengthened my tale over long ,LOTR1,False
7001, the rest must be more brief ,LOTR1,False
7002, in rohan i found evil already at work: the lie of saruman; and the king of the land would not listen to my warning ,LOTR1,False
7003, he bade me take a horse and be gone; and i chose one much to my liking but little to hi ,LOTR1,False
7004, i took the best horse in hi land and i have never seen the like of him ,LOTR1,False
7005, then he must be a noble beast indeed  said aragorn; and it grieve me more than many tiding that might seem worse to learn that sauron levie such tribute ,LOTR1,False
7006, it wa not so when last i wa in that land ,LOTR1,False
7007, nor i it now i will swear  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
7008, it i a lie that come from the enemy ,LOTR1,False
7009, i know the men of rohan; true and valiant our allie dwelling still in the land that we gave them long ago ,LOTR1,False
7010, the shadow of mordor lie on distant land  answered aragorn ,LOTR1,False
7011, saruman ha fallen under it ,LOTR1,False
7012, who know what you will find there if ever you return ,LOTR1,False
7013, said boromir that they will buy their live with horse ,LOTR1,False
7014, they love their horse next to their kin ,LOTR1,False
7015, and not without reason for the horse of the riddermark come from the field of the north far from the shadow and their race a that of their master i descended from the free day of old ,LOTR1,False
7016, and there i one among them that might have been foaled in the morning of the world ,LOTR1,False
7017, the horse of the nine cannot vie with him; tirel swift a the flowing wind ,LOTR1,False
7018, by day hi coat glisten like silver; and by night it i like a shade and he passe unseen ,LOTR1,False
7019, never before had any man mounted him but i took him and i tamed him and so speedily he bore me that i reached the shire when frodo wa on the barrow down though i set out from rohan only when he set out from hobbiton ,LOTR1,False
7020, but fear grew in me a i rode ,LOTR1,False
7021, ever a i came north i heard tiding of the rider and though i gained on them day by day they were ever before me ,LOTR1,False
7022, they had divided their force i learned: some remained on the eastern border not far from the greenway ,LOTR1,False
7023, and some invaded the shire from the south ,LOTR1,False
7024, i came to hobbiton and frodo had gone; but i had word with old gamgee ,LOTR1,False
7025, many word and few to the point ,LOTR1,False
7026, he had much to say about the shortcoming of the new owner of bag end ,LOTR1,False
7027,  i cant abide change said he not at my time of life and least of all change for the worst ,LOTR1,False
7028, change for the worst he repeated many time ,LOTR1,False
7029,  worst i a bad word i said to him and i hope you do not live to see it ,LOTR1,False
7030, but amidst hi talk i gathered at last that frodo had left hobbiton l than a week before and that a black horseman had come to the hill the same evening ,LOTR1,False
7031, then i rode on in fear ,LOTR1,False
7032, i came to buckland and found it in uproar a busy a a hive of ant that ha been stirred with a stick ,LOTR1,False
7033, i came to the house at crickhollow and it wa broken open and empty; but on the threshold there lay a cloak that had been frodo ,LOTR1,False
7034, then for a while hope left me and i did not wait to gather new or i might have been comforted; but i rode on the trail of the rider ,LOTR1,False
7035, it wa hard to follow for it went many way and i wa at a los ,LOTR1,False
7036, but it seemed to me that one or two had ridden toward bree; and that way i went for i thought of word that might be said to the innkeeper ,LOTR1,False
7037,  butterbur they call him thought i ,LOTR1,False
7038, if thi delay wa hi fault i will melt all the butter in him ,LOTR1,False
7039, i will roast the old fool over a slow fire ,LOTR1,False
7040, he expected no l and when he saw my face he fell down flat and began to melt on the spot ,LOTR1,False
7041, what did you do to him ,LOTR1,False
7042, he wa really very kind to u and did all that he could ,LOTR1,False
7043, i did not bite and i barked very little ,LOTR1,False
7044, so overjoyed wa i by the new that i got out of him when he stopped quaking that i embraced the old fellow ,LOTR1,False
7045, how it happened i could not then gu but i learned that you had been in bree the night before and had gone off that morning with strider ,LOTR1,False
7046, i cried shouting for joy ,LOTR1,False
7047, ye sir i am afraid so sir said butterbur mistaking me ,LOTR1,False
7048, he got at them in spite of all that i could do and they took up with him ,LOTR1,False
7049, they behaved very queer all the time they were here: wilful you might say ,LOTR1,False
7050, thrice worthy and beloved barliman ,LOTR1,False
7051, it the best new i have had since midsummer: it worth a gold piece at the least ,LOTR1,False
7052, may your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for seven years ,LOTR1,False
7053, now i can take a night rest the first since i have forgotten when ,LOTR1,False
7054, sol stayed there that night wondering much what had become of the riders; for only of two had there yet been any new in bree it seemed ,LOTR1,False
7055, but in the night we heard more ,LOTR1,False
7056, five at least came from the west and they threw down the gate and passed through bree like a howling wind; and the bree folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world ,LOTR1,False
7057, i got up before dawn and went after them ,LOTR1,False
7058, i do not know but it seem clear to me that thi i what happened ,LOTR1,False
7059, their captain remained in secret away south of bree while two rode ahead through the village and four more invaded the shire ,LOTR1,False
7060, but when these were foiled in bree and at crickhollow they returned to their captain with tiding and so left the road unguarded for a while except by their spie ,LOTR1,False
7061, the captain then sent some eastward straight acros country and he himself with the rest rode along the road in great wrath ,LOTR1,False
7062, i galloped to weathertop like a gale and i reached it before sundown on my second day from bree and they were there before me ,LOTR1,False
7063, they drew away from me for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it while the sun wa in the sky ,LOTR1,False
7064, but they closed round at night and i wa besieged on the hill top in the old ring of amon syl ,LOTR1,False
7065, i wa hard put to it indeed: such light and flame cannot have been seen on weathertop since the war beacon of old ,LOTR1,False
7066, at sunrise i escaped and fled toward the north ,LOTR1,False
7067, i could not hope to do more ,LOTR1,False
7068, it wa impossible to find you frodo in the wildern and it would have been folly to try with all the nine at my heel ,LOTR1,False
7069, sol had to trust to aragorn ,LOTR1,False
7070, but i hoped to draw some of them off and yet reach rivendell ahead of you and send out help ,LOTR1,False
7071, four rider did indeed follow me but they turned back after a while and made for the ford it seem that helped a little for there were only five not nine when your camp wa attacked ,LOTR1,False
7072, i reached here at last by a long hard road up the floarwell and through the ettenmoor and down from the north ,LOTR1,False
7073, it took me nearly fourteen day from weathertop for i could not ride among the rock of the troll fell and shadowfax departed ,LOTR1,False
7074, i sent him back to hi master; but a great friendship ha grown between u and if i have need he will come at my call ,LOTR1,False
7075, but so it wa that i came to rivendell only three day before the ring and new of it peril had already been brought here which proved well indeed ,LOTR1,False
7076, and that frodo i the end of my account ,LOTR1,False
7077, may elrond and the other forgive the length of it ,LOTR1,False
7078, but such a thing ha not happened before that gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised ,LOTR1,False
7079, an account to the ring bearer of so strange an event wa required i think ,LOTR1,False
7080, well the tale i now told from first to last ,LOTR1,False
7081, here we all are and here i the ring ,LOTR1,False
7082, but we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose ,LOTR1,False
7083, what shall we do with it ,LOTR1,False
7084, at last elrond spoke again ,LOTR1,False
7085, thi i grievou new concerning saruman  he said; for we trusted him and he i deep in all our counsel ,LOTR1,False
7086, it i perilou to study too deeply the art of the enemy for good or for ill ,LOTR1,False
7087, but such fall and betrayal ala have happened before ,LOTR1,False
7088, of the tale that we have heard thi day the tale of frodo wa most strange to me ,LOTR1,False
7089, i have known few hobbit save bilbo here; and it seem to me that he i perhap not so alone and singular a i had thought him ,LOTR1,False
7090, the world ha changed much since i last wa on the westward road ,LOTR1,False
7091, the barrow wight we know by many names; and of the old forest many tale have been told: all that now remain i but an outlier of it northern march ,LOTR1,False
7092, time wa when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what i now the shire to dunland west of isengard ,LOTR1,False
7093, in those land i journeyed once and many thing wild and strange i knew ,LOTR1,False
7094, but i had forgotten bombadil if indeed thi i still the same that walked the wood and hill long ago and even then wa older than the old ,LOTR1,False
7095, that wa not then hi name ,LOTR1,False
7096, iarwain ben adar we called him oldest and fatherl ,LOTR1,False
7097, but many another name he ha since been given by other folk: forn by the dwarve orald by northern men and other name beside ,LOTR1,False
7098, he i a strange creature but maybe i should have summoned him to our council ,LOTR1,False
7099, he would not have come  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7100, could we not still send message to him and obtain hi help ,LOTR1,False
7101, it seem that he ha a power even over the ring ,LOTR1,False
7102, no i should not put it so  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7103, say rather that the ring ha no power over him ,LOTR1,False
7104, he i hi own master ,LOTR1,False
7105, but he cannot alter the ring itself nor break it power over other ,LOTR1,False
7106, and now he i withdrawn into a little land within bound that he ha set though none can see them waiting perhap for a change of day and he will not step beyond them ,LOTR1,False
7107, but within those bound nothing seem to dismay him  said erestor ,LOTR1,False
7108, would he not take the ring and keep it there for ever harmless ,LOTR1,False
7109, no  said gandalf not willingly ,LOTR1,False
7110, he might do so if all the free folk of the world begged him but he would not understand the need ,LOTR1,False
7111, and if he were given the ring he would soon forget it or most likely throw it away ,LOTR1,False
7112, such thing have no hold on hi mind ,LOTR1,False
7113, he would be a most unsafe guardian; and that alone i answer enough ,LOTR1,False
7114, but in any case  said glorfindel to send the ring to him would only postpone the day of evil ,LOTR1,False
7115, we could not now take it back to him unguessed unmarked by any spy ,LOTR1,False
7116, and even if we could soon or late the lord of the ring would learn of it hiding place and would bend all hi power toward it ,LOTR1,False
7117, could that power be defied by bombadil alone ,LOTR1,False
7118, i think that in the end if all else i conquered bombadil will fall last a he wa first; and then night will come ,LOTR1,False
7119, i know little of iarwain save the name  said galdor; but glorfindel i think i right ,LOTR1,False
7120, power to defy our enemy i not in him unl such power i in the earth itself ,LOTR1,False
7121, and yet we see that sauron can torture and destroy the very hill ,LOTR1,False
7122, what power still remain lie with u here in imladri or with cirdan at the haven or in lurien ,LOTR1,False
7123, but have they the strength have we here the strength to withstand the enemy the coming of sauron at the last when all else i overthrown ,LOTR1,False
7124, i have not the strength  said elrond; neither have they ,LOTR1,False
7125, then if the ring cannot be kept from him for ever by strength said glorfindel two thing only remain for u to attempt: to send it over the sea or to destroy it ,LOTR1,False
7126, but gandalf ha revealed to u that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here poss  said elrond ,LOTR1,False
7127, and they who dwell beyond the sea would not receive it: for good or ill it belong to middle earth; it i for u who still dwell here to deal with it ,LOTR1,False
7128, then said glorfindel let u cast it into the deep and so make the lie of saruman come true ,LOTR1,False
7129, for it i clear now that even at the council hi feet were already on a crooked path ,LOTR1,False
7130, he knew that the ring wa not lost for ever but wished u to think so; for he began to lust for it for himself ,LOTR1,False
7131, yet oft in lie truth i hidden: in the sea it would be safe ,LOTR1,False
7132, not safe for ever  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7133, there are many thing in the deep waters; and sea and land may change ,LOTR1,False
7134, and it i not our part here to take thought only for a season or for a few live of men or for a passing age of the world ,LOTR1,False
7135, we should seek a final end of thi menace even if we do not hope to make one ,LOTR1,False
7136, and that we shall not find on the road to the sea  said galdor ,LOTR1,False
7137, if the return to iarwain be thought too dangerou then flight to the a i now fraught with gravest peril ,LOTR1,False
7138, my heart tell me that sauron will expect u to take the western way when he learn what ha befallen ,LOTR1,False
7139, the nine have been unhorsed indeed but that i but a respite ere they find new steed and swifter ,LOTR1,False
7140, only the waning might of gondor stand now between him and a march in power along the coast into the north; and if he come assailing the white tower and the haven hereafter the elve may have no escape from the lengthening shadow of middle earth ,LOTR1,False
7141, long yet will that march be delayed  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
7142, but gondor stand and even the end of it strength i still very strong ,LOTR1,False
7143, and yet it vigilance can no longer keep back the nine  said galdor ,LOTR1,False
7144, and other road he may find that gondor doe not guard ,LOTR1,False
7145, then  said erestor there are but two course a glorfindel already ha declared: to hide the ring for ever; or to unmake it ,LOTR1,False
7146, but both are beyond our power ,LOTR1,False
7147, who will read thi riddle for us ,LOTR1,False
7148, none here can do so  said elrond gravely ,LOTR1,False
7149, at least none can foretell what will come to pas if we take thi road or that ,LOTR1,False
7150, but it seem to me now clear which i the road that we must take ,LOTR1,False
7151, the westward road seem easiest ,LOTR1,False
7152, therefore it must be shunned ,LOTR1,False
7153, too often the elve have fled that way ,LOTR1,False
7154, now at thi last we must take a hard road a road unforeseen ,LOTR1,False
7155, there lie our hope if hope it be ,LOTR1,False
7156, to walk into peril to mordor ,LOTR1,False
7157, we must send the ring to the fire ,LOTR1,False
7158, frodo even in that fair house looking out upon a sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear water felt a dead darkn in hi heart ,LOTR1,False
7159, boromir stirred and frodo looked at him ,LOTR1,False
7160, he wa fingering hi great horn and frowning ,LOTR1,False
7161, i do not understand all thi  he said ,LOTR1,False
7162, saruman i a traitor but did he not have a glimpse of wisdom ,LOTR1,False
7163, why do you speak ever of hiding and destroying ,LOTR1,False
7164, why should we not think that the great ring ha come into our hand to serve u in the very hour of need ,LOTR1,False
7165, wielding it the free lord of the free may surely defeat the enemy ,LOTR1,False
7166, that i what he most fear i deem ,LOTR1,False
7167, the men of gondor are valiant and they will never submit; but they may be beaten down ,LOTR1,False
7168, valour need first strength and then a weapon ,LOTR1,False
7169, let the ring be your weapon if it ha such power a you say ,LOTR1,False
7170, take it and go forth to victory ,LOTR1,False
7171, ala no  said elrond ,LOTR1,False
7172, we cannot use the ruling ring ,LOTR1,False
7173, that we now know too well ,LOTR1,False
7174, it belong to sauron and wa made by him alone and i altogether evil ,LOTR1,False
7175, it strength boromir i too great for anyone to wield at will save only those who have already a great power of their own ,LOTR1,False
7176, but for them it hold an even deadlier peril ,LOTR1,False
7177, the very desire of it corrupt the heart ,LOTR1,False
7178, if any of the wise should with thi ring overthrow the lord of mordor using hi own art he would then set himself on sauron throne and yet another dark lord would appear ,LOTR1,False
7179, and that i another reason why the ring should be destroyed: a long a it i in the world it will be a danger even to the wise ,LOTR1,False
7180, for nothing i evil in the beginning ,LOTR1,False
7181, even sauron wa not so ,LOTR1,False
7182, i fear to take the ring to hide it ,LOTR1,False
7183, i will not take the ring to wield it ,LOTR1,False
7184, nor i  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7185, boromir looked at them doubtfully but he bowed hi head ,LOTR1,False
7186, so be it  he said ,LOTR1,False
7187, then in gondor we must trust to such weapon a we have ,LOTR1,False
7188, and at the least while the wise one guard thi ring we will fight on ,LOTR1,False
7189, mayhap the sword that was broken may still stem the tide if the hand that wield it ha inherited not an heirloom only but the sinew of the king of men ,LOTR1,False
7190, but we will put it to the test one day ,LOTR1,False
7191, may the day not be too long delayed  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
7192, for though i do not ask for aid we need it ,LOTR1,False
7193, it would comfort u to know that other fought also with all the mean that they have ,LOTR1,False
7194, then be comforted  said elrond ,LOTR1,False
7195, for there are other power and realm that you know not and they are hidden from you ,LOTR1,False
7196, anduin the great flow past many shore ere it come to argonath and the gate of gondor ,LOTR1,False
7197, still it might be well for all  said gluin the dwarf if all these strength were joined and the power of each were used in league ,LOTR1,False
7198, other ring there may be l treacherou that might be used in our need ,LOTR1,False
7199, the seven are lost to u if balin ha not found the ring of thrur which wa the last; naught ha been heard of it since thrur perished in moria ,LOTR1,False
7200, indeed i may now reveal that it wa partly in hope to find that ring that balin went away ,LOTR1,False
7201, balin will find no ring in moria  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7202, thrur gave it to thrbin hi son but not thrbin to thorin ,LOTR1,False
7203, it wa taken with torment from thrbin in the dungeon of dol guldur ,LOTR1,False
7204, when will the day come of our revenge ,LOTR1,False
7205, but still there are the three ,LOTR1,False
7206, what of the three ring of the elves ,LOTR1,False
7207, very mighty ring it i said ,LOTR1,False
7208, do not the elf lord keep them ,LOTR1,False
7209, yet they too were made by the dark lord long ago ,LOTR1,False
7210, i see elf lord here ,LOTR1,False
7211, the elve returned no answer ,LOTR1,False
7212, did you not hear me gluin ,LOTR1,False
7213, the three were not made by sauron nor did he ever touch them ,LOTR1,False
7214, but of them it i not permitted to speak ,LOTR1,False
7215, so much only in this hour of doubt i may now say ,LOTR1,False
7216, but they were not made a weapon of war or conquest: that i not their power ,LOTR1,False
7217, those who made them did not desire strength or domination or hoarded wealth but understanding making and healing to preserve all thing unstained ,LOTR1,False
7218, these thing the elve of middle earth have in some measure gained though with sorrow ,LOTR1,False
7219, but all that ha been wrought by those who wield the three will turn to their undoing and their mind and heart will become revealed to sauron if he regain the one ,LOTR1,False
7220, it would be better if the three had never been ,LOTR1,False
7221, but what then would happen if the ruling ring were destroyed a you counsel ,LOTR1,False
7222, we know not for certain  answered elrond sadly ,LOTR1,False
7223, some hope that the three ring which sauron ha never touched would then become free and their ruler might heal the hurt of the world that he ha wrought ,LOTR1,False
7224, but maybe when the one ha gone the three will fail and many fair thing will fade and be forgotten ,LOTR1,False
7225, yet all the elve are willing to endure thi chance  said glorfindel if by it the power of sauron may be broken and the fear of hi dominion be taken away for ever ,LOTR1,False
7226, thu we return once more to the destroying of the ring  said erestor and yet we come no nearer ,LOTR1,False
7227, what strength have we for the finding of the fire in which it wa made ,LOTR1,False
7228, that i the path of despair ,LOTR1,False
7229, of folly i would say if the long wisdom of elrond did not forbid me ,LOTR1,False
7230, it i not despair for despair i only for those who see the end beyond all doubt ,LOTR1,False
7231, it i wisdom to recognize necessity when all other course have been weighed though a folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope ,LOTR1,False
7232, well let folly be our cloak a veil before the eye of the enemy ,LOTR1,False
7233, for he i very wise and weigh all thing to a nicety in the scale of hi malice ,LOTR1,False
7234, but the only measure that he know i desire desire for power; and so he judge all heart ,LOTR1,False
7235, into hi heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it that having the ring we may seek to destroy it ,LOTR1,False
7236, if we seek thi we shall put him out of reckoning ,LOTR1,False
7237, at least for a while  said elrond ,LOTR1,False
7238, the road must be trod but it will be very hard ,LOTR1,False
7239, and neither strength nor wisdom will carry u far upon it ,LOTR1,False
7240, thi quest may be attempted by the weak with a much hope a the strong ,LOTR1,False
7241, yet such i oft the course of deed that move the wheel of the world: small hand do them because they must while the eye of the great are elsewhere ,LOTR1,False
7242, very well very well master elrond ,LOTR1,False
7243, it i plain enough what you are pointing at ,LOTR1,False
7244, bilbo the silly hobbit started thi affair and bilbo had better finish it or himself ,LOTR1,False
7245, i wa very comfortable here and getting on with my book ,LOTR1,False
7246, if you want to know i am just writing an ending for it ,LOTR1,False
7247, i had thought of putting: and he lived happily ever afterward to the end of hi day ,LOTR1,False
7248, it i a good ending and none the worse for having been used before ,LOTR1,False
7249, now i shall have to alter that: it doe not look like coming true; and anyway there will evidently have to be several more chapter if i live to write them ,LOTR1,False
7250, it i a frightful nuisance ,LOTR1,False
7251, when ought i to start ,LOTR1,False
7252,  boromir looked in surprise at bilbo but the laughter died on hi lip when he saw that all the other regarded the old hobbit with grave respect ,LOTR1,False
7253, only gluin smiled but hi smile came from old memorie ,LOTR1,False
7254, of course my dear bilbo  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7255, if you had really started thi affair you might be expected to finish it ,LOTR1,False
7256, but you know well enough now that starting i too great a claim for any and that only a small part i played in great deed by any hero ,LOTR1,False
7257, though the word wa meant and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer ,LOTR1,False
7258, but one beyond your strength bilbo ,LOTR1,False
7259, you cannot take thi thing back ,LOTR1,False
7260, if you need my advice any longer i should say that your part i ended unl a a recorder ,LOTR1,False
7261, finish your book and leave the ending unaltered ,LOTR1,False
7262, there i still hope for it ,LOTR1,False
7263, but get ready to write a sequel when they come back ,LOTR1,False
7264, i have never known you give me pleasant advice before ,LOTR1,False
7265, a all your unpleasant advice ha been good i wonder if thi advice i not bad ,LOTR1,False
7266, still i dont suppose i have the strength or luck left to deal with the ring ,LOTR1,False
7267, it ha grown and i have not ,LOTR1,False
7268, but tell me: what do you mean by they ,LOTR1,False
7269, the messenger who are sent with the ring ,LOTR1,False
7270, and who are they to be ,LOTR1,False
7271, that seem to me what thi council ha to decide and all that it ha to decide ,LOTR1,False
7272, elve may thrive on speech alone and dwarve endure great weariness; but i am only an old hobbit and i mis my meal at noon ,LOTR1,False
7273, cant you think of some name now ,LOTR1,False
7274, or put it off till after dinner ,LOTR1,False
7275, frodo glanced at all the face but they were not turned to him ,LOTR1,False
7276, all the council sat with downcast eye a if in deep thought ,LOTR1,False
7277, a great dread fell on him a if he wa awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be spoken ,LOTR1,False
7278, an overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by bilbo side in rivendell filled all hi heart ,LOTR1,False
7279, at last with an effort he spoke and wondered to hear hi own word a if some other will wa using hi small voice ,LOTR1,False
7280, i will take the ring  he said though i do not know the way ,LOTR1,False
7281, elrond raised hi eye and looked at him and frodo felt hi heart pierced by the sudden keenn of the glance ,LOTR1,False
7282, if i understand aright all that i have heard  he said i think that thi task i appointed for you frodo; and that if you do not find a way no one will ,LOTR1,False
7283, thi i the hour of the shire folk when they arise from their quiet field to shake the tower and counsel of the great ,LOTR1,False
7284, who of all the wise could have foreseen it ,LOTR1,False
7285, or if they are wise why should they expect to know it until the hour ha struck ,LOTR1,False
7286, but it i a heavy burden ,LOTR1,False
7287, so heavy that none could lay it on another ,LOTR1,False
7288, i do not lay it on you ,LOTR1,False
7289, but if you take it freely i will say that your choice i right; and though all the mighty elf friend of old hador and hrin and trin and beren himself were assembled together your seat should be among them ,LOTR1,False
7290, but you wont send him off alone surely master ,LOTR1,False
7291, cried sam unable to contain himself any longer and jumping up from the corner where he had been quietly sitting on the floor ,LOTR1,False
7292, said elrond turning toward him with a smile ,LOTR1,False
7293, you at least shall go with him ,LOTR1,False
7294, it i hardly possible to separate you from him even when he i summoned to a secret council and you are not ,LOTR1,False
7295, sam sat down blushing and muttering ,LOTR1,False
7296, a nice pickle we have landed ourselve in mr frodo ,LOTR1,False
7297, he said shaking hi head ,LOTR1,False
7298, the ring goe south later that day the hobbit held a meeting of their own in bilbo room ,LOTR1,False
7299, merry and pippin were indignant when they heard that sam had crept into the council and had been chosen a frodo companion ,LOTR1,False
7300, it most unfair  said pippin ,LOTR1,False
7301, instead of throwing him out and clapping him in chain elrond goe and reward him for hi cheek ,LOTR1,False
7302, i cant imagine a more severe punishment ,LOTR1,False
7303, you are not thinking what you are saying: condemned to go on thi hopel journey a reward ,LOTR1,False
7304, yesterday i dreamed that my task wa done and i could rest here a long while perhap for good ,LOTR1,False
7305, i dont wonder  said merry and i wish you could ,LOTR1,False
7306, but we are envying sam not you ,LOTR1,False
7307, if you have to go then it will be a punishment for any of u to be left behind even in rivendell ,LOTR1,False
7308, we have come a long way with you and been through some stiff time ,LOTR1,False
7309, we want to go on ,LOTR1,False
7310, that what i meant  said pippin ,LOTR1,False
7311, we hobbit ought to stick together and we will ,LOTR1,False
7312, i shall go unl they chain me up ,LOTR1,False
7313, there must be someone with intelligence in the party ,LOTR1,False
7314, then you certainly will not be chosen peregrin took ,LOTR1,False
7315, said gandalf looking in through the window which wa near the ground ,LOTR1,False
7316, but you are all worrying yourselve unnecessarily ,LOTR1,False
7317, then what were you all doing ,LOTR1,False
7318, you were shut up for hour ,LOTR1,False
7319, there wa a deal of talk and everyone had an eye opener ,LOTR1,False
7320, i think legolas bit of new about gollum caught even him on the hop though he passed it off ,LOTR1,False
7321, you were wrong  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7322, i had already heard of it from gwaihir ,LOTR1,False
7323, if you want to know the only real eye opener a you put it were you and frodo; and i wa the only one that wa not surprised ,LOTR1,False
7324, well anyway  said bilbo nothing wa decided beyond choosing poor frodo and sam ,LOTR1,False
7325, i wa afraid all the time that it might come to that if i wa let off ,LOTR1,False
7326, but if you ask me elrond will send out a fair number when the report come in ,LOTR1,False
7327, have they started yet gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7328, ye  said the wizard ,LOTR1,False
7329, some of the scout have been sent out already ,LOTR1,False
7330, elrond i sending elve and they will get in touch with the ranger and maybe with thranduil folk in mirkwood ,LOTR1,False
7331, and aragorn ha gone with elrond son ,LOTR1,False
7332, we shall have to scour the land all round for many long league before any move i made ,LOTR1,False
7333, you will probably make quite along stay here ,LOTR1,False
7334, well just wait long enough for winter to come ,LOTR1,False
7335, that cant be helped  said bilbo ,LOTR1,False
7336, it your fault partly frodo my lad: insisting on waiting for my birthday ,LOTR1,False
7337, a funny way of honouring it i cant help thinking ,LOTR1,False
7338, not the day i should have chosen for letting the ,LOTR1,False
7339, but there it is: you cant wait now fill spring; and you cant go till the report come back ,LOTR1,False
7340, when winter first begin to bite and stone crack in the frosty night when pool are black and tree are bare ti evil in the wild to fare ,LOTR1,False
7341, but that i am afraid will be just your luck ,LOTR1,False
7342, i am afraid it will  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7343, we cant start until we have found out about the rider ,LOTR1,False
7344, t thought they were all destroyed in the flood  said merry ,LOTR1,False
7345, you cannot destroy ringwraith like that  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7346, the power of their master i in them and they stand or fall by him ,LOTR1,False
7347, we hope that they were all unhorsed and unmasked and so made for a while l dangerous; but we must find out for certain ,LOTR1,False
7348, in the meantime you should try and forget your trouble frodo ,LOTR1,False
7349, i do not know if i can do anything to help you; but i will whisper thi in your ear ,LOTR1,False
7350, someone said that intelligence would be needed in the party ,LOTR1,False
7351, i think i shall come with you ,LOTR1,False
7352, so great wa frodo delight at thi announcement that gandalf left the window sill where he had been sitting and took off hi hat and bowed ,LOTR1,False
7353, i only said i think i shall come ,LOTR1,False
7354, do not count on anything yet ,LOTR1,False
7355, in thi matter elrond will have much to say and your friend the strider ,LOTR1,False
7356, which remind me i want to see elrond ,LOTR1,False
7357, how long do you think i shall have here ,LOTR1,False
7358, said frodo to bilbo when gandalf had gone ,LOTR1,False
7359, i cant count day in rivendell  said bilbo ,LOTR1,False
7360, but quite long i should think ,LOTR1,False
7361, we can have many a good talk ,LOTR1,False
7362, what about helping me with my book and making a start on the next ,LOTR1,False
7363, have you thought of an ending ,LOTR1,False
7364, ye several and all are dark and unpleasant  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
7365, book ought to have good ending ,LOTR1,False
7366, how would thi do: and they all settled down and lived together happily ever after ,LOTR1,False
7367, it will do well if it ever come to that  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
7368, and where will they live ,LOTR1,False
7369, that what i often wonder ,LOTR1,False
7370, for a while the hobbit continued to talk and think of the past journey and of the peril that lay ahead; but such wa the virtue of the land of rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety wa lifted from their mind ,LOTR1,False
7371, the future good or ill wa not forgotten but ceased to have any power over the present ,LOTR1,False
7372, health and hope grew strong in them and they were content with each good day a it came taking pleasure in every meal and in every word and song ,LOTR1,False
7373, so the day slipped away a each morning dawned bright and fair and each evening followed cool and clear ,LOTR1,False
7374, but autumn wa waning fast; slowly the golden light faded to pale silver and the lingering leave fell from the naked tree ,LOTR1,False
7375, a wind began to blow chill from the misty mountain to the east ,LOTR1,False
7376, the hunter moon waxed round in the night sky and put to flight all the lesser star ,LOTR1,False
7377, but low in the south one star shone red ,LOTR1,False
7378, every night a the moon waned again it shone brighter and brighter ,LOTR1,False
7379, frodo could see it from hi window deep in the heaven burning like a watchful eye that glared above the tree on the brink of the valley ,LOTR1,False
7380, the hobbit had been nearly two month in the house of elrond and november had gone by with the last shred of autumn and december wa passing when the scout began to return ,LOTR1,False
7381, some had gone north beyond the spring of the hoarwell into the ettenmoors; and other had gone west and with the help of aragorn and the ranger had searched the land far down the greyflood a far a tharbad where the old north road crossed the river by a ruined town ,LOTR1,False
7382, many had gone east and south; and some of these had crossed the mountain and entered mirkwood while other had climbed the pas at the source of the gladden river and had come down into wilderland and over the gladden field and so at length had reached the old home of radagast at rhosgobel ,LOTR1,False
7383, radagast wa not there; and they had returned over the high pas that wa called the dimrill stair ,LOTR1,False
7384, the son of elrond elladan and elrohir were the last to return; they had made a great journey passing down the silverlode into a strange country but of their errand they would not speak to any save to elrond ,LOTR1,False
7385, in no region had the messenger discovered any sign or tiding of the rider or other servant of the enemy ,LOTR1,False
7386, even from the eagle of the misty mountain they had learned no fresh new ,LOTR1,False
7387, nothing had been seen or heard of gollum; but the wild wolve were still gathering and were hunting again far up the great river ,LOTR1,False
7388, three of the black horse had been found at once drowned in the flooded ford ,LOTR1,False
7389, on the rock of the rapid below it searcher discovered the bodie of five more and also a long black cloak slashed and tattered ,LOTR1,False
7390, of the black rider no other trace wa to be seen and nowhere wa their presence to be felt ,LOTR1,False
7391, it seemed that they had vanished from the north ,LOTR1,False
7392, eight out of the nine are accounted for at least  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7393, it i rash to be too sure yet i think that we may hope now that the ringwraith were scattered and have been obliged to return a best they could to their master in mordor empty and shapel ,LOTR1,False
7394, tf that i so it will be some time before they can begin the hunt again ,LOTR1,False
7395, of course the enemy ha other servant but they will have to journey all the way to the border of rivendell before they can pick up our trail ,LOTR1,False
7396, and if we are careful that will be hard to find ,LOTR1,False
7397, but we must delay no longer ,LOTR1,False
7398, elrond summoned the hobbit to him ,LOTR1,False

7666, a they passed overhead in so dense a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below one harsh croak wa heard ,LOTR1,False

7760, frodo felt a soft touch on hi face ,LOTR1,False
7761, he put out hi arm and saw the dim white flake of snow settling on hi sleeve ,LOTR1,False

7767, folk might welcome it there ,LOTR1,False
7768, except on the high moor of the northfarthing a heavy fall wa rare in the shire and wa regarded a a pleasant event and a chance for fun ,LOTR1,False
7769, no living hobbit (save bilbo) could remember the fell winter of number number when the white wolve invaded the shire over the frozen brandywine ,LOTR1,False

7789, they heard eerie noise in the darkn round them ,LOTR1,False
7790, it may have been only a trick of the wind in the crack and gullie of the rocky wall but the sound were those of shrill crie and wild howl of laughter ,LOTR1,False
7791, stone began to fall from the mountain side whistling over their head or crashing on the path beside them ,LOTR1,False
7792, every now and again they heard a dull rumble a a great boulder rolled down from hidden height above ,LOTR1,False
7793, we cannot go further tonight  said boromir ,LOTR1,False

7804, it i no good going on ,LOTR1,False
7805, only a little higher if i remember rightly thi path leave the cliff and run into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard slope ,LOTR1,False
7806, we should have no shelter there from snow or stone or anything else ,LOTR1,False
7807, and it i no good going back while the storm hold  said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
7808, we have passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter than thi cliff wall we are under now ,LOTR1,False
7809, if thi i shelter then one wall and no roof make a house ,LOTR1,False
7810, the company now gathered together a close to the cliff a they could ,LOTR1,False
7811, it faced southward and near the bottom it leaned out a little so that they hoped it would give them some protection from the northerly wind and from the falling stone ,LOTR1,False
7812, but eddying blast swirled round them from every side and the snow flowed down in ever denser cloud ,LOTR1,False
7813, they huddled together with their back to the wall ,LOTR1,False
7814, bill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbit and screened them a little; but before long the drifting snow wa above hi hock and it went on mounting ,LOTR1,False
7815, if they had had no larger companion the hobbit would soon have been entirely buried ,LOTR1,False
7816, a great sleepin came over frodo; he felt himself sinking fast into a warm and hazy dream ,LOTR1,False
7817, he thought a fire wa heating hi toe and out of the shadow on the other side of the hearth he heard bilbo voice speaking ,LOTR1,False
7818, / don t think much of your diary he said ,LOTR1,False
7819, snowstorm on january the twelfth: there wa no need to come back to report that ,LOTR1,False
7820, but i wanted rest and sleep bilbo frodo answered with an effort when he felt himself shaken and he came back painfully to wakefuln ,LOTR1,False

7830, the other also revived and found fresh hope and vigour ,LOTR1,False
7831, but the snow did not relent ,LOTR1,False

7833, what do you say to fire ,LOTR1,False
7834, the choice seem near now between fire and death gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7835, doubtl we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eye when the snow ha covered u but that will not help u ,LOTR1,False
7836, you may make a fire if you can  answered gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7837, if there are any watcher that can endure thi storm then they can see u fire or no ,LOTR1,False
7838, but though they had brought wood and kindling by the advice of boromir it passed the skill of elf or even dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel ,LOTR1,False
7839, at last reluctantly gandalf himself took a hand ,LOTR1,False
7840, picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment and then with a word of command naur an edraith ammen  ,LOTR1,False
7841, he thrust the end of hi staff into the midst of it ,LOTR1,False
7842, at once a great spout of green and blue flame sprang out and the wood flared and sputtered ,LOTR1,False
7843, if there are any to see then i at least am revealed to them  he said ,LOTR1,False
7844, i have written gandalf i here in sign that all can read from rivendell to the mouth of anduin ,LOTR1,False
7845, but the company cared no longer for watcher or unfriendly eye ,LOTR1,False
7846, their heart were rejoiced to see the light of the fire ,LOTR1,False
7847, the wood burned merrily; and though all round it the snow hissed and pool of slush crept under their feet they warmed their hand gladly at the blaze ,LOTR1,False
7848, there they stood stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flame ,LOTR1,False
7849, a red light wa on their tired and anxiou faces; behind them the night wa like a black wall ,LOTR1,False
7850, but the wood wa burning fast and the snow still fell ,LOTR1,False
7851, and the last faggot wa thrown on ,LOTR1,False
7852, the night i getting old  said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
7853, the dawn i not far off ,LOTR1,False
7854, if any dawn can pierce these cloud  said gimli ,LOTR1,False
7855, boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackn ,LOTR1,False
7856, the snow i growing l  he said and the wind i quieter ,LOTR1,False
7857, frodo gazed wearily at the flake still falling out of the dark to be revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire; but for a long time he could see no sign of their slackening ,LOTR1,False
7858, then suddenly a sleep wa beginning to creep over him again he wa aware that the wind had indeed fallen and the flake were becoming larger and fewer ,LOTR1,False
7859, very slowly a dim light began to grow ,LOTR1,False
7860, at last the snow stopped altogether ,LOTR1,False
7861, a the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world ,LOTR1,False
7862, below their refuge were white hump and dome and shapel deep beneath which the path that they had trodden wa altogether lost; but the height above were hidden in great cloud still heavy with the threat of snow ,LOTR1,False
7863, gimli looked up and shook hi head ,LOTR1,False
7864, caradhra ha not forgiven u ,LOTR1,False
7865, he ha more snow yet to fling at u if we go on ,LOTR1,False
7866, the sooner we go back and down the better ,LOTR1,False
7867, to thi all agreed but their retreat wa now difficult ,LOTR1,False
7868, it might well prove impossible ,LOTR1,False
7869, only a few pace from the ashe of their fire the snow lay many feet deep higher than the head of the hobbits; in place it had been scooped and piled by the wind into great drift against the cliff ,LOTR1,False
7870, if gandalf would go before u with a bright flame he might melt a path for you  said legola ,LOTR1,False
7871, the storm had troubled him little and he alone of the company remained still light of heart ,LOTR1,False
7872, if elve could fly over mountain they might fetch the sun to save u  answered gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7873, but i must have something to work on ,LOTR1,False
7874, well  said boromir when head are at a los bodie must serve a we say in my country ,LOTR1,False
7875, the strongest of u must seek a way ,LOTR1,False
7876, though all i now snow clad our path a we came up turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder ,LOTR1,False
7877, it wa there that the snow first began to burden u ,LOTR1,False
7878, if we could reach that point maybe it would prove easier beyond ,LOTR1,False
7879, it i no more than a furlong off i gu ,LOTR1,False
7880, then let u force a path thither you and i ,LOTR1,False
7881, aragorn wa the tallest of the company but boromir little l in height wa broader and heavier in build ,LOTR1,False
7882, he led the way and aragorn followed him ,LOTR1,False
7883, slowly they moved off and were soon toiling heavily ,LOTR1,False
7884, in place the snow wa breast high and often boromir seemed to be swimming or burrowing with hi great arm rather than walking ,LOTR1,False
7885, legola watched them for a while with a smile upon hi lip and then he turned to the other ,LOTR1,False
7886, the strongest must seek a way say you ,LOTR1,False
7887, but i say: let a ploughman plough but choose an otter for swimming and for running light over gras and leaf or over snow an elf ,LOTR1,False
7888, with that he sprang forth nimbly and then frodo noticed a if for the first time though he had long known it that the elf had no boot but wore only light shoe a he alway did and hi feet made little imprint in the snow ,LOTR1,False
7889, i go to find the sun ,LOTR1,False
7890, then swift a a runner over firm sand he shot away and quickly overtaking the toiling men with a wave of hi hand he passed them and sped into the distance and vanished round the rocky turn ,LOTR1,False
7891, the other waited huddled together watching until boromir and aragorn dwindled into black speck in the whiten ,LOTR1,False
7892, at length they too passed from sight ,LOTR1,False
7893, the cloud lowered and now a few flake of snow came curling down again ,LOTR1,False
7894, an hour maybe went by though it seemed far longer and then at last they saw legola coming back ,LOTR1,False
7895, at the same time boromir and aragorn reappeared round the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope ,LOTR1,False
7896, well  cried legola a he ran up i have not brought the sun ,LOTR1,False
7897, she i walking in the blue field of the south and a little wreath of snow on thi redhorn hillock trouble her not at all ,LOTR1,False
7898, but i have brought back a gleam of good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet ,LOTR1,False
7899, there i the greatest wind drift of all just beyond the turn and there our strong men were almost buried ,LOTR1,False
7900, they despaired until i returned and told them that the drift wa little wider than a wall ,LOTR1,False
7901, and on the other side the snow suddenly grow l while further down it i no more than a white coverlet to cool a hobbit toe ,LOTR1,False
7902, ah it i a i said  growled gimli ,LOTR1,False
7903, it wa no ordinary storm ,LOTR1,False
7904, it i the ill will of caradhra ,LOTR1,False
7905, he doe not love elve and dwarve and that drift wa laid to cut off our escape ,LOTR1,False
7906, but happily your caradhra ha forgotten that you have men with you  said boromir who came up at that moment ,LOTR1,False
7907, and doughty men too if i may say it; though lesser men with spade might have served you better ,LOTR1,False
7908, still we have thrust a lane through the drift; and for that all here may be grateful who cannot run a light a elve ,LOTR1,False
7909, but how are we to get down there even if you have cut through the drift ,LOTR1,False
7910, said pippin voicing the thought of all the hobbit ,LOTR1,False
7911, i am weary but i still have some strength left and aragorn too ,LOTR1,False
7912, we will bear the little folk ,LOTR1,False
7913, the other no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind u ,LOTR1,False
7914, i will begin with you ,LOTR1,False
7915, he lifted up the hobbit ,LOTR1,False
7916, i shall need my arms he said and strode forward ,LOTR1,False
7917, aragorn with merry came behind ,LOTR1,False
7918, pippin marvelled at hi strength seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other tool than hi great limb ,LOTR1,False
7919, even now burdened a he wa he wa widening the track for those who followed thrusting the snow aside a he went ,LOTR1,False
7920, they came at length to the great drift ,LOTR1,False
7921, it wa flung acros the mountain path like a sheer and sudden wall and it crest sharp a if shaped with knive reared up more than twice the height of boromir; but through the middle a passage had been beaten rising and falling like a bridge ,LOTR1,False
7922, on the far side merry and pippin were set down and there they waited with legola for the rest of the company to arrive ,LOTR1,False
7923, after a while boromir returned carrying sam ,LOTR1,False
7924, behind in the narrow but now well trodden track came gandalf leading bill with gimli perched among the baggage ,LOTR1,False
7925, last came aragorn carrying frodo ,LOTR1,False
7926, they passed through the lane; but hardly had frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall of stone and slithering snow ,LOTR1,False
7927, the spray of it half blinded the company a they crouched against the cliff and when the air cleared again they saw that the path wa blocked behind them ,LOTR1,False
7928, we are departing a quickly a we may ,LOTR1,False
7929, and indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be expended a if caradhra wa satisfied that the invader had been beaten off and would not dare to return ,LOTR1,False
7930, the threat of snow lifted; the cloud began to break and the light grew broader ,LOTR1,False
7931, a legola had reported they found that the snow became steadily more shallow a they went down so that even the hobbit could trudge along ,LOTR1,False
7932, soon they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope where they had felt the first flake of snow the night before ,LOTR1,False
7933, the morning wa now far advanced ,LOTR1,False
7934, from the high place they looked back westward over the lower land ,LOTR1,False
7935, far away in the tumble of country that lay at the foot of the mountain wa the dell from which they had started to climb the pas ,LOTR1,False
7936, he wa chilled to the bone and hungry; and hi head wa dizzy a he thought of the long and painful march downhill ,LOTR1,False
7937, black speck swam before hi eye ,LOTR1,False
7938, he rubbed them but the black speck remained ,LOTR1,False
7939, in the distance below him but still high above the lower foothill dark dot were circling in the air ,LOTR1,False
7940, that cannot be helped now  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7941, whether they are good or evil or have nothing to do with u at all we must go down at once ,LOTR1,False
7942, not even on the knee of caradhra will we wait for another night fall ,LOTR1,False
7943, a cold wind flowed down behind them a they turned their back on the redhorn gate and stumbled wearily down the slope ,LOTR1,False
7944, a journey in the dark it wa evening and the grey light wa again waning fast when they halted for the night ,LOTR1,False
7945, the mountain were veiled in deepening dusk and the wind wa cold ,LOTR1,False
7946, gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of rivendell ,LOTR1,False
7947, when they had eaten some food he called a council ,LOTR1,False
7948, we cannot of course go on again tonight  he said ,LOTR1,False
7949, the attack on the redhorn gate ha tired u out and we must rest here for a while ,LOTR1,False
7950, and then where are we to go ,LOTR1,False
7951, we still have our journey and our errand before u  answered gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7952, we have no choice but to go on or to return to rivendell ,LOTR1,False
7953, pippin face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to rivendell; merry and sam looked up hopefully ,LOTR1,False
7954, but aragorn and boromir made no sign ,LOTR1,False
7955, i wish i wa back there  he said ,LOTR1,False
7956, but how can i return without shame unl there i indeed no other way and we are already defeated ,LOTR1,False
7957,  you are right frodo  said gandalf: to go back i to admit defeat and face worse defeat to come ,LOTR1,False
7958, if we go back now then the ring must remain there: we shall not be able to set out again ,LOTR1,False
7959, then sooner or later rivendell will be besieged and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed ,LOTR1,False
7960, the ringwraith are deadly enemie but they are only shadow yet of the power and terror they would poss if the ruling ring wa on their master hand again ,LOTR1,False
7961, then we must go on if there i a way  said frodo with a sigh ,LOTR1,False
7962, sam sank back into gloom ,LOTR1,False
7963, there i a way that we may attempt  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7964, i thought from the beginning when first i considered thi journey that we should try it ,LOTR1,False
7965, but it i not a pleasant way and i have not spoken of it to the company before ,LOTR1,False
7966, aragorn wa against it until the pas over the mountain had at least been tried ,LOTR1,False
7967, if it i a worse road than the redhorn gate then it must be evil indeed  said merry ,LOTR1,False
7968, but you had better tell u about it and let u know the worst at once ,LOTR1,False
7969, the road that i speak of lead to the mine of moria  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7970, only gimli lifted up hi head; a smouldering fire wa in hi eye ,LOTR1,False
7971, on all the other a dread fell at the mention of that name ,LOTR1,False
7972, even to the hobbit it wa a legend of vague fear: the road may lead to moria but how can we hope that it will lead through moria ,LOTR1,False
7973, it i a name of ill omen  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
7974, nor do i see the need to go there ,LOTR1,False
7975, if we cannot cros the mountain let u journey southward until we come to the gap of rohan where men are friendly to my people taking the road that i followed on my way hither ,LOTR1,False
7976, or we might pas by and cros the isen into langstrand and lebennin and so come to gondor from the region nigh to the sea ,LOTR1,False
7977, thing have changed since you came north boromir  answered gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7978, did you not hear what i told you of saruman ,LOTR1,False
7979, with him i may have busin of my own ere all i over ,LOTR1,False
7980, but the ring must not come near isengard if that can by any mean be prevented ,LOTR1,False
7981, the gap of rohan i closed to u while we go with the bearer ,LOTR1,False
7982, a for the longer road: we cannot afford the time ,LOTR1,False
7983, we might spend a year in such a journey and we should pas through many land that are empty and harbourl ,LOTR1,False
7984, yet they would not be safe ,LOTR1,False
7985, the watchful eye both of saruman and of the enemy are on them ,LOTR1,False
7986, when you came north boromir you were in the enemy eye only one stray wanderer from the south and a matter of small concern to him: hi mind wa busy with the pursuit of the ring ,LOTR1,False
7987, but you return now a a member of the ring company and you are in peril a long a you remain with u ,LOTR1,False
7988, the danger will increase with every league that we go south under the naked sky ,LOTR1,False
7989, since our open attempt on the mountain pas our plight ha become more desperate i fear ,LOTR1,False
7990, i see now little hope if we do not soon vanish from sight for a while and cover our trail ,LOTR1,False
7991, therefore i advise that we should go neither over the mountain nor round them but under them ,LOTR1,False
7992, that i a road at any rate that the enemy will least expect u to take ,LOTR1,False
7993, we do not know what he expect  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
7994, lie may watch all road likely and unlikely ,LOTR1,False
7995, in that case to enter moria would be to walk into a trap hardly better than knocking at the gate of the dark tower itself ,LOTR1,False
7996, the name of moria i black ,LOTR1,False
7997, you speak of what you do not know when you liken moria to the stronghold of sauron  answered gandalf ,LOTR1,False
7998, i alone of you have ever been in the dungeon of the dark lord and only in hi older and lesser dwelling in dol guldur ,LOTR1,False
7999, those who pas the gate of barad dyr do not return ,LOTR1,False
8000, but i would not lead you into moria if there were no hope of coming out again ,LOTR1,False
8001, if there are ore there it may prove ill for u that i true ,LOTR1,False
8002, but most of the ore of the misty mountain were scattered or destroyed in the battle of five armie ,LOTR1,False
8003, the eagle report that ore are gathering again from afar; but there i a hope that moria i still free ,LOTR1,False
8004, there i even a chance that dwarve are there and that in some deep hall of hi father balin son of fundin may be found ,LOTR1,False
8005, however it may prove one must tread the path that need chooses ,LOTR1,False
8006, i will tread the path with you gandalf ,LOTR1,False
8007, i will go and look on the hall of durin whatever may wait there if you can find the door that are shut ,LOTR1,False
8008, we will seek the hidden door together ,LOTR1,False
8009, and we will come through ,LOTR1,False
8010, in the ruin of the dwarve a dwarf head will be l easy to bewilder than elve or men or hobbit ,LOTR1,False
8011, yet it will not be the first time that i have been to moria ,LOTR1,False
8012, i sought there long for thrbin son of thrur after he wa lost ,LOTR1,False
8013, i passed through and i came out again alive ,LOTR1,False
8014,  i too once passed the dimrill gate  said aragorn quietly; but though i also came out again the memory i very evil ,LOTR1,False
8015, i do not wish to enter moria a second time ,LOTR1,False
8016, and i dont wish to enter it even once  said pippin ,LOTR1,False
8017, nor me  muttered sam ,LOTR1,False
8018, but the question is: who will follow me if i lead you there ,LOTR1,False
8019,  i will  said gimli eagerly ,LOTR1,False
8020, i will  said aragorn heavily ,LOTR1,False
8021, you followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow and have said no word of blame ,LOTR1,False
8022, i will follow your lead now if thi last warning doe not move you ,LOTR1,False
8023, it i not of the ring nor of u other that i am thinking now but of you gandalf ,LOTR1,False
8024, and i say to you: if you pas the door of moria beware ,LOTR1,False
8025,  i will not go  said boromir; not unl the vote of the whole company i against me ,LOTR1,False
8026, what do legola and the little folk say ,LOTR1,False
8027, the ring bearer voice surely should be heard ,LOTR1,False
8028,  i do not wish to go to moria  said legola ,LOTR1,False
8029, i do not wish to go  he said; but neither do i wish to refuse the advice of gandalf ,LOTR1,False
8030, i beg that there should be no vote until we have slept on it ,LOTR1,False
8031, gandalf will get vote easier in the light of the morning than in thi cold gloom ,LOTR1,False
8032, how the wind howl  ,LOTR1,False
8033,  at these word all fell into silent thought ,LOTR1,False
8034, they heard the wind hissing among the rock and tree and there wa a howling and wailing round them in the empty space of the night ,LOTR1,False
8035, suddenly aragorn leapt to hi feet ,LOTR1,False
8036, how the wind howl  ,LOTR1,False
8037, it i howling with wolf voice ,LOTR1,False
8038, the warg have come west of the mountains ,LOTR1,False
8039, f need we wait until morning then ,LOTR1,False

8041, even if we live to see the dawn who now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolve on hi trail ,LOTR1,False
8042,  how far i moria ,LOTR1,False

8044, then let u start a soon a it i light tomorrow if we can  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
8045, the wolf that one hear i worse than the ore that one fear ,LOTR1,False
8046, said aragorn loosening hi sword in it sheath ,LOTR1,False
8047, but where the warg howl there also the ore prowl ,LOTR1,False
8048, i wish i had taken elrond advice  muttered pippin to sam ,LOTR1,False
8049, i am no good after all ,LOTR1,False
8050, there i not enough of the breed of bandobra the bullroarer in me: these howl freeze my blood ,LOTR1,False
8051, i dont ever remember feeling so wretched ,LOTR1,False
8052, my heart right down in my toe mr pippin  said sam ,LOTR1,False
8053, but we arent etten yet and there are some stout folk here with u ,LOTR1,False
8054, whatever may be in store for old gandalf ill wager it isnt a wolf belly ,LOTR1,False
8055, for their defence in the night the company climbed to the top of the small hill under which they had been sheltering it wa crowned with a knot of old and twisted tree about which lay a broken circle of boulder stone ,LOTR1,False
8056, in the midst of thi they lit a fire for there wa no hope that darkn and silence would keep their trail from discovery by the hunting pack ,LOTR1,False
8057, round the fire they sat and those that were not on guard dozed uneasily ,LOTR1,False
8058, poor bill the pony trembled and sweated where he stood ,LOTR1,False
8059, the howling of the wolve wa now all round them sometime nearer and sometime further off ,LOTR1,False
8060, in the dead of the night many shining eye were seen peering over the brow of the hill ,LOTR1,False
8061, some advanced almost to the ring of stone ,LOTR1,False
8062, at a gap in the circle a great dark wolf shape could be seen halted gazing at them ,LOTR1,False
8063, a shuddering howl broke from him a if he were a captain summoning hi pack to the assault ,LOTR1,False
8064, gandalf stood up and strode forward holding hi staff aloft ,LOTR1,False
8065, fly if you value your foul skin ,LOTR1,False
8066, i will shrivel you from tail to snout if you come within thi ring ,LOTR1,False
8067, the wolf snarled and sprang toward them with a great leap ,LOTR1,False
8068, at that moment there wa a sharp twang ,LOTR1,False
8069, legola had loosed hi bow ,LOTR1,False
8070, there wa a hideou yell and the leaping shape thudded to the ground; the elvish arrow had pierced it throat ,LOTR1,False
8071, the watching eye were suddenly extinguished ,LOTR1,False
8072, gandalf and aragorn strode forward but the hill wa deserted; the hunting pack had fled ,LOTR1,False
8073, all about them the darkn grew silent and no cry came on the sighing wind ,LOTR1,False
8074, the night wa old and westward the waning moon wa setting gleaming fitfully through the breaking cloud ,LOTR1,False
8075, suddenly frodo started from sleep ,LOTR1,False
8076, without warning a storm of howl broke out fierce and wild all about the camp ,LOTR1,False
8077, a great host of warg had gathered silently and wa now attacking them from every side at once ,LOTR1,False
8078, fling fuel on the fire ,LOTR1,False
8079, cried gandalf to the hobbit ,LOTR1,False
8080, draw your blade and stand back to back ,LOTR1,False
8081, in the leaping light a the fresh wood blazed up frodo saw many grey shape spring over the ring of stone ,LOTR1,False
8082, through the throat of one huge leader aragorn passed hi sword with a thrust; with a great sweep boromir hewed the head off another ,LOTR1,False
8083, beside them gimli stood with hi stout leg apart wielding hi dwarf axe ,LOTR1,False
8084, the bow of legola wa singing ,LOTR1,False
8085, in the wavering firelight gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set upon a hill ,LOTR1,False
8086, stooping like a cloud he lifted a burning branch and strode to meet the wolve ,LOTR1,False
8087, they gave back before him ,LOTR1,False
8088, high in the air he tossed the blazing brand ,LOTR1,False
8089, it flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning; and hi voice rolled like thunder ,LOTR1,False
8090,  naur an edraith ammen ,LOTR1,False
8091, there wa a roar and a crackle and the tree above him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame ,LOTR1,False
8092, the fire leapt from tree top to tree top ,LOTR1,False
8093, the whole hill wa crowned with dazzling light ,LOTR1,False
8094, the sword and knive of the defender shone and flickered ,LOTR1,False
8095, the last arrow of legola kindled in the air a it flew and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf chieftain ,LOTR1,False
8096, slowly the fire died till nothing wa left but falling ash and sparks; a bitter smoke curled above the burned tree stump and blew darkly from the hill a the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky ,LOTR1,False
8097, their enemie were routed and did not return ,LOTR1,False
8098, what did i tell you mr pippin ,LOTR1,False
8099,  said sam she/thing hi sword ,LOTR1,False
8100, that wa an eye opener and no mistake ,LOTR1,False
8101, nearly singed the hair off my head ,LOTR1,False
8102, when the full light of the morning came no sign of the wolve were to be found and they looked in vain for the bodie of the dead ,LOTR1,False
8103, no trace of the fight remained but the charred tree and the arrow of legola lying on the hill top ,LOTR1,False
8104, all were undamaged save one of which only the point wa left ,LOTR1,False
8105, it i a i feared  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
8106, these were no ordinary wolve hunting for food in the wildern ,LOTR1,False
8107, let u eat quickly and go ,LOTR1,False
8108, that day the weather changed again almost a if it wa at the command of some power that had no longer any use for snow since they had retreated from the pas a power that wished now to have a clear light in which thing that moved in the wild could be seen from far away ,LOTR1,False
8109, the wind had been turning through north to north west during the night and now it failed ,LOTR1,False
8110, the cloud vanished southward and the sky wa opened high and blue ,LOTR1,False
8111, a they stood upon the hill side ready to depart a pale sunlight gleamed over the mountain top ,LOTR1,False
8112, we must reach the door before sunset  said gandalf or i fear we shall not reach them at all ,LOTR1,False
8113, it i not far but our path may be winding for here aragorn cannot guide us; he ha seldom walked in thi country and only once have i been under the west wall of moria and that wa long ago ,LOTR1,False
8114, there it lie  he said pointing away south eastward to where the mountains side fell sheer into the shadow at their feet ,LOTR1,False
8115, in the distance could be dimly seen a line of bare cliff and in their midst taller than the rest one great grey wall ,LOTR1,False
8116, when we left the pas i led you southward and not back to our starting point a some of you may have noticed ,LOTR1,False
8117, it i well that i did so for now we have several mile l to cros and haste i needed ,LOTR1,False
8118,  i do not know which to hope  said boromir grimly: that gandalf will find what he seek or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gate lost for ever ,LOTR1,False
8119, all choice seem ill and to be caught between wolve and the wall the likeliest chance ,LOTR1,False
8120, gimli now walked ahead by the wizard side so eager wa he to come to moria ,LOTR1,False
8121, together they led the company back toward the mountain ,LOTR1,False
8122, the only road of old to moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream the sirannon that ran out from the feet of the cliff near where the door had stood ,LOTR1,False
8123, but either gandalf wa astray or else the land had changed in recent years; for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it only a few mile southward from their start ,LOTR1,False
8124, the morning wa passing toward noon and still the company wandered and scrambled in a barren country of red stone ,LOTR1,False
8125, nowhere could they see any gleam of water or hear any sound of it ,LOTR1,False
8126, all wa bleak and dry ,LOTR1,False
8127, they saw no living thing and not a bird wa in the sky; but what the night would bring if it caught them in that lost land none of them cared to think ,LOTR1,False
8128, suddenly gimli who had pressed on ahead called back to them ,LOTR1,False
8129, he wa standing on a knoll and pointing to the right ,LOTR1,False
8130, hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow channel ,LOTR1,False
8131, it wa empty and silent and hardly a trickle of water flowed among the brown and red stained stone of it bed; but on the near side there wa a path much broken and decayed that wound it way among the ruined wall and paving stone of an ancient highroad ,LOTR1,False
8132, here it i at last ,LOTR1,False
8133, thi i where the stream ran: sirannon the gate stream they used to call it ,LOTR1,False
8134, but what ha happened to the water i cannot guess; it used to be swift and noisy ,LOTR1,False
8135, the company were footsore and tired; but they trudged doggedly along the rough and winding track for many mile ,LOTR1,False
8136, the sun turned from the noon and began to go west ,LOTR1,False
8137, after a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again ,LOTR1,False
8138, before them the mountain frowned but their path lay in a deep trough of land and they could see only the higher shoulder and the far eastward peak ,LOTR1,False
8139, at length they came to a sharp bend ,LOTR1,False
8140, there the road which had been veering southward between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the land to the left turned and went due east again ,LOTR1,False
8141, rounding the corner they saw before them a low cliff some five fathom high with a broken and jagged top ,LOTR1,False
8142, over it a trickling water dripped through a wide cleft that seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full ,LOTR1,False
8143, but there i no mistaking the place ,LOTR1,False
8144, there i all that remain of the stair fall ,LOTR1,False
8145, if i remember right there wa a flight of step cut in the rock at their side but the main road wound away left and climbed with several loop up to the level ground at the top ,LOTR1,False
8146, there used to be a shallow valley beyond the fall right up to the wall of moria and the sirannon flowed through it with the road beside it ,LOTR1,False
8147, let u go and see what thing are like now  ,LOTR1,False
8148,  they found the stone step without difficulty and gimli sprang swiftly up them followed by gandalf and frodo ,LOTR1,False
8149, when they reached the top they saw that they could go no further that way and the reason for the drying up of the gate stream wa revealed ,LOTR1,False
8150, behind them the sinking sun filled the cool western sky with glimmering gold ,LOTR1,False
8151, before them stretched a dark still lake ,LOTR1,False
8152, neither sky nor sunset wa reflected on it sullen surface ,LOTR1,False
8153, the sirannon had been dammed and had filled all the valley ,LOTR1,False
8154, beyond the ominou water were reared vast cliff their stern face pallid in the fading light: final and impassable ,LOTR1,False
8155, no sign of gate or entrance not a fissure or crack could frodo see in the frowning stone ,LOTR1,False
8156, there are the wall of moria  said gandalf pointing acros the water ,LOTR1,False
8157, and there the gate stood once upon a time the elven door at the end of the road from flollin by which we have come ,LOTR1,False
8158, but thi way i blocked ,LOTR1,False
8159, none of the company i gu will wish to swim thi gloomy water at the end of the day ,LOTR1,False
8160, it ha an unwholesome look ,LOTR1,False
8161, we must find a way round the northern edge  said gimli ,LOTR1,False
8162, the first thing for the company to do i to climb up by the main path and see where that will lead u ,LOTR1,False
8163, even if there were no lake we could not get our baggage pony up thi stair ,LOTR1,False
8164, but in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the mine  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
8165, the road under the mountain i a dark road and there are place narrow and steep which he cannot tread even if we can ,LOTR1,False
8166, i had not thought of that ,LOTR1,False
8167, i wonder what he will say ,LOTR1,False
8168,  i am sorry  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
8169, poor bill ha been a useful companion and it goe to my heart to turn him adrift now ,LOTR1,False
8170, i would have travelled lighter and brought no animal least of all thi one that sam i fond of if i had had my way ,LOTR1,False
8171, i feared all along that we should be obliged to take thi road ,LOTR1,False
8172, the day wa drawing to it end and cold star were glinting in the sky high above the sunset when the company with all the speed they could climbed up the slope and reached the side of the lake ,LOTR1,False

8239, the moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock; but they could see nothing else for a while ,LOTR1,False
8240, then slowly on the surface where the wizard hand had passed faint line appeared like slender vein of silver running in the stone ,LOTR1,False
8241, at first they were no more than pale gossamer thread so fine that they only twinkled fitfully where the moon caught them but steadily they grew broader and clearer until their design could be guessed ,LOTR1,False

8440, hi sense were sharper and more aware of thing that could not be seen ,LOTR1,False
8441, one sign of change that he soon had noticed wa that he could see more in the dark than any of hi companion save perhap gandalf ,LOTR1,False
8442, and he wa in any case the bearer of the ring: it hung upon it chain against hi breast and at while it seemed a heavy weight ,LOTR1,False
8443, he felt the certainty of evil ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing ,LOTR1,False
8444, he gripped tighter on the hilt of hi sword and went on doggedly ,LOTR1,False
8445, the company behind him spoke seldom and then only in hurried whisper ,LOTR1,False
8446, there wa no sound but the sound of their own feet; the dull stump of gimli dwarf boots; the heavy tread of boromir; the light step of legolas; the soft scarce heard patter of hobbit feet; and in the rear the slow firm footfall of aragorn with hi long stride ,LOTR1,False
8447, when they halted for a moment they heard nothing at all unl it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water ,LOTR1,False
8448, yet frodo began to hear or to imagine that he heard something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet ,LOTR1,False
8449, it wa never loud enough or near enough for him to feel certain that he heard it; but once it had started it never stopped while the company wa moving ,LOTR1,False
8450, but it wa not an echo for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself and then grew still ,LOTR1,False
8451, it wa after nightfall when they had entered the mine ,LOTR1,False
8452, they had been going for several hour with only brief halt when gandalf came to hi first seriou check ,LOTR1,False
8453, before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three passages: all led in the same general direction eastwards; but the left hand passage plunged down while the right hand climbed up and the middle way seemed to run on smooth and level but very narrow ,LOTR1,False
8454, i have no memory of thi place at all ,LOTR1,False
8455, said gandalf standing uncertainly under the arch ,LOTR1,False
8456, he held up hi staff in the hope of finding some mark or inscription that might help hi choice; but nothing of the kind wa to be seen ,LOTR1,False
8457, i am too weary to decide  he said shaking hi head ,LOTR1,False
8458, and i expect that you are all a weary a i am or wearier ,LOTR1,False
8459, we had better halt here for what i left of the night ,LOTR1,False
8460, you know what i mean ,LOTR1,False
8461, in here it i ever dark; but outside the late moon i riding westward and the middle night ha passed ,LOTR1,False
8462, i wonder where he i ,LOTR1,False
8463, i hope those wolve havent got him yet ,LOTR1,False
8464, to the left of the great arch they found a stone door: it wa half closed but swung back easily to a gentle thrust ,LOTR1,False
8465, beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock ,LOTR1,False
8466,  cried gandalf a merry and pippin pushed forward glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of shelter than in the open passage ,LOTR1,False
8467, you do not know what i inside yet ,LOTR1,False
8468, he went in cautiously and the other filed behind ,LOTR1,False
8469,  he said pointing with hi staff to the middle of the floor ,LOTR1,False
8470, before hi feet they saw a large round hole like the mouth of a well ,LOTR1,False
8471, broken and rusty chain lay at the edge and trailed down into the black pit ,LOTR1,False
8472, fragment of stone lay near ,LOTR1,False
8473, one of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were going to strike the bottom  said aragorn to merry ,LOTR1,False
8474, let the guide go first while you have one ,LOTR1,False
8475, thi seem to have been a guardroom made for the watching of the three passage  said gimli ,LOTR1,False
8476, that hole wa plainly a well for the guards use covered with a stone lid ,LOTR1,False
8477, but the lid i broken and we must all take care in the dark ,LOTR1,False
8478, pippin felt curiously attracted by the well ,LOTR1,False
8479, while the other were unrolling blanket and making bed against the wall of the chamber a far a possible from the hole in the floor he crept to the edge and peered over ,LOTR1,False
8480, a chill air seemed to strike hi face rising from invisible depth ,LOTR1,False
8481, moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone and let it drop ,LOTR1,False
8482, he felt hi heart beat many time before there wa any sound ,LOTR1,False
8483, then far below a if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernou place there came a plunk very distant but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft ,LOTR1,False
8484, he wa relieved when pippin confessed what he had done; but he wa angry and pippin could see hi eye glinting ,LOTR1,False
8485, thi i a seriou journey not a hobbit walking party ,LOTR1,False
8486, throw yourself in next time and then you will be no further nuisance ,LOTR1,False
8487,  nothing more wa heard for several minutes; but then there came out of the depth faint knocks: tom tap tap tom ,LOTR1,False
8488, they stopped and when the echoe had died away they were repeated: tap tom tom tap tap tap tom ,LOTR1,False
8489, they sounded disquietingly like signal of some sort; but after a while the knocking died away and wa not heard again ,LOTR1,False
8490, that wa the sound of a hammer or i have never heard one  said gimli ,LOTR1,False
8491, ye  said gandalf and i do not like it ,LOTR1,False
8492, it may have nothing to do with peregrin foolish stone; but probably something ha been disturbed that would have been better left quiet ,LOTR1,False
8493, pray do nothing of the kind again ,LOTR1,False
8494, let u hope we shall get some rest without further trouble ,LOTR1,False
8495, you pippin can go on the first watch a a reward  he growled a he rolled himself in a blanket ,LOTR1,False
8496, pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he kept on turning round fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the well ,LOTR1,False
8497, he wished he could cover the hole if only with a blanket but he dared not move or go near it even though gandalf seemed to be asleep ,LOTR1,False
8498, actually gandalf wa awake though lying still and silent ,LOTR1,False
8499, he wa deep in thought trying to recall every memory of hi former journey in the mine and considering anxiously the next course that he should take; a false turn now might be disastrou ,LOTR1,False
8500, after an hour he rose up and came over to pippin ,LOTR1,False
8501, get into a corner and have a sleep my lad  he said in a kindly tone ,LOTR1,False
8502, you want to sleep i expect ,LOTR1,False
8503, i cannot get a wink so i may a well do the watching ,LOTR1,False
8504, i know what i the matter with me  he muttered a he sat down by the door ,LOTR1,False
8505, i have not tasted it since the morning before the snowstorm ,LOTR1,False
8506, the last thing that pippin saw a sleep took him wa a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddled on the floor shielding a glowing chip in hi gnarled hand between hi knee ,LOTR1,False
8507, the flicker for a moment showed hi sharp nose and the puff of smoke ,LOTR1,False
8508, it wa gandalf who roused them all from sleep ,LOTR1,False
8509, he had sat and watched all alone for about six hour and had let the other rest ,LOTR1,False
8510, and in the watche i have made up my mind  he said ,LOTR1,False
8511, i do not like the feel of the middle way; and i do not like the smell of the left hand way: there i foul air down there or i am no guide ,LOTR1,False
8512, i shall take the right hand passage ,LOTR1,False
8513, it i time we began to climb up again ,LOTR1,False
8514, for eight dark hour not counting two brief halt they marched on; and they met no danger and heard nothing and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the wizard light bobbing like a will o the wisp in front of them ,LOTR1,False
8515, the passage they had chosen wound steadily upward ,LOTR1,False
8516, a far a they could judge it went in great mounting curve and a it rose it grew loftier and wider ,LOTR1,False
8517, there were now no opening to other gallerie or tunnel on either side and the floor wa level and sound without pit or crack ,LOTR1,False
8518, evidently they had struck what once had been an important road; and they went forward quicker than they had done on their first march ,LOTR1,False
8519, in thi way they advanced some fifteen mile measured in a direct line east though they must have actually walked twenty mile or more ,LOTR1,False
8520, a the road climbed upwards frodo spirit rose a little; but he still felt oppressed and still at time he heard or thought he heard away behind the company and beyond the fall and patter of their feet a following footstep that wa not an echo ,LOTR1,False
8521, they had marched a far a the hobbit could endure without a rest and all were thinking of a place where they could sleep when suddenly the wall to right and left vanished ,LOTR1,False
8522, they seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into a black and empty space ,LOTR1,False
8523, there wa a great draught of warmer air behind them and before them the darkn wa cold on their face ,LOTR1,False
8524, they halted and crowded anxiously together ,LOTR1,False
8525, i chose the right way  he said ,LOTR1,False
8526, at last we are coming to the habitable part and i gu that we are not far now from the eastern side ,LOTR1,False
8527, but we are high up a good deal higher than the dimrill gate unl i am mistaken ,LOTR1,False
8528, from the feeling of the air we must be in a wide hall ,LOTR1,False
8529, i will now risk a little real light ,LOTR1,False
8530, he raised hi staff and for a brief instant there wa blaze like a flash of lightning ,LOTR1,False
8531, great shadow sprang up and fled and for a second they saw a vast roof far above their head upheld by many mighty pillar hewn of stone ,LOTR1,False
8532, before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall; it black wall polished and smooth a glas flashed and glittered ,LOTR1,False
8533, three other entrance they saw dark black arches: one straight before them eastward and one on either side ,LOTR1,False
8534, then the light went out ,LOTR1,False
8535, that i all that i shall venture on for the present  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
8536, there used to be great window on the mountain side and shaft leading out to the light in the upper reache of the mine ,LOTR1,False
8537, i think we have reached them now but it i night outside again and we cannot tell until morning ,LOTR1,False
8538, if i am right tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in ,LOTR1,False
8539, but in the meanwhile we had better go no further ,LOTR1,False
8540, let u rest if we can ,LOTR1,False
8541, thing have gone well so far and the greater part of the dark road i over ,LOTR1,False
8542, but we are not through yet and it i a long way down to the gate that open on the world ,LOTR1,False
8543, the company spent that night in the great cavernou hall huddled close together in a corner to escape the draught: there seemed to be a steady inflow of chill air through the eastern archway ,LOTR1,False
8544, all about them a they lay hung the darkn hollow and immense and they were oppressed by the lonelin and vastn of the dolven hall and endlessly branching stair and passage ,LOTR1,False
8545, the wildest imagining that dark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbit fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of moria ,LOTR1,False
8546, there must have been a mighty crowd of dwarve here at one time  said sam; and every one of them busier than badger for five hundred year to make all thi and most in hard rock too ,LOTR1,False
8547, what did they do it all for ,LOTR1,False
8548, they didnt live in these darksome hole surely ,LOTR1,False
8549,  these are not hole  said gimli ,LOTR1,False
8550, thi i the great realm and city of the dwarrowdelf ,LOTR1,False
8551, and of old it wa not darksome but full of light and splendour a i still remembered in our song ,LOTR1,False
8552, he rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice while the echoe ran away into the roof ,LOTR1,False
8553, the world wa young the mountain green no stain yet on the moon wa seen no word were laid on stream or stone when durin woke and walked alone ,LOTR1,False
8554, he named the namel hill and dells; he drank from yet untasted wells; he stooped and looked in mirrormere and saw a crown of star appear a gem upon a silver thread above the shadow of hi head ,LOTR1,False
8555, the world wa fair the mountain tall in elder day before the fall of mighty king in nargothrond and gondolin who now beyond the western sea have passed away: the world wa fair in durin  day ,LOTR1,False
8556, a king he wa on carven throne in many pillared hall of stone with golden roof and silver floor and rune of power upon the door ,LOTR1,False
8557, the light of sun and star and moon in shining lamp of crystal hewn undimmed by cloud or shade of night there shone for ever fair and bright ,LOTR1,False
8558, there hammer on the anvil smote there chisel clove and graver wrote; there forged wa blade and bound wa the delver mined the mason built ,LOTR1,False
8559, there beryl pearl and opal pale and metal wrought like fishes mail buckler and corslet axe and sword and shining spear were laid in hoard ,LOTR1,False
8560, unwearied then were durin  folk beneath the mountain music woke: the harper harped the minstrel sang and at the gate the trumpet rang ,LOTR1,False
8561, the world i grey the mountain old the forge fire i ashen cold no harp i wrung no hammer falls: the darkn dwell in durin  hall the shadow lie upon hi tomb in moria in khazad dym ,LOTR1,False
8562, but still the sunken star appear in dark and windl mirrormere; there lie hi crown in water deep till durin wake again from sleep ,LOTR1,False
8563, v i should like to learn it ,LOTR1,False
8564, in moria in khazad dym  ,LOTR1,False
8565, but it make the darkn seem heavier thinking of all those lamp ,LOTR1,False
8566, are there pile of jewel and gold lying about here still ,LOTR1,False
8567, having sung hi song he would say no more ,LOTR1,False
8568, the ore have often plundered moria; there i nothing left in the upper hall ,LOTR1,False
8569, and since the dwarve fled no one dare to seek the shaft and treasurie down in the deep places: they are drowned in water or in a shadow of fear ,LOTR1,False
8570, then what do the dwarve want to come back for ,LOTR1,False
8571, the wealth of moria wa not in gold and jewel the toy of the dwarves; nor in iron their servant ,LOTR1,False
8572, such thing they found here it i true especially iron; but they did not need to delve for them: all thing that they desired they could obtain in traffic ,LOTR1,False
8573, for here alone in the world wa found moria silver or true silver a some have called it: mithril i the elvish name ,LOTR1,False
8574, the dwarve have a name which they do not tell ,LOTR1,False
8575, it worth wa ten time that of gold and now it i beyond price; for little i left above ground and even the ore dare not delve here for it ,LOTR1,False
8576, the lode lead away north toward caradhra and down to darkn ,LOTR1,False
8577, the dwarve tell no tale; but even a mithril wa the foundation of their wealth so also it wa their destruction: they delved too greedily and too deep and disturbed that from which they fled durin bane ,LOTR1,False
8578, of what they brought to light the ore have gathered nearly all and given it in tribute to sauron who covet it ,LOTR1,False
8579, it could be beaten like copper and polished like glass; and the dwarve could make of it a metal light and yet harder than tempered steel ,LOTR1,False
8580, it beauty wa like to that of common silver but the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim ,LOTR1,False
8581, the elve dearly loved it and among many use they made of it ithildin starmoon which you saw upon the door ,LOTR1,False
8582, bilbo had a corslet of mithril ring that thorin gave him ,LOTR1,False
8583, i wonder what ha become of it ,LOTR1,False
8584, gathering dust still in michel delving mathom house i suppose ,LOTR1,False
8585,  cried gimli startled out of hi silence ,LOTR1,False
8586, a corslet of moria silver ,LOTR1,False
8587, that wa a kingly gift ,LOTR1,False
8588,  ye  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
8589, i never told him but it worth wa greater than the value of the whole shire and everything in it ,LOTR1,False
8590, frodo said nothing but he put hi hand under hi tunic and touched the ring of hi mail shirt ,LOTR1,False
8591, he felt staggered to think that he had been walking about with the price of the shire under hi jacket ,LOTR1,False
8592, he felt no doubt that bilbo knew quite well ,LOTR1,False
8593, it wa indeed a kingly gift ,LOTR1,False
8594, but now hi thought had been carried away from the dark mine to rivendell to bilbo and to bag end in the day while bilbo wa still there ,LOTR1,False
8595, he wished with all hi heart that he wa back there and in those day mowing the lawn or pottering among the flower and that he had never heard of moria or mithril or the ring ,LOTR1,False
8596, one by one the other fell asleep ,LOTR1,False
8597, a if it were a breath that came in through unseen door out of deep place dread came over him ,LOTR1,False
8598, hi hand were cold and hi brow damp ,LOTR1,False
8599, all hi mind wa given to listening and nothing else for two slow hours; but he heard no sound not even the imagined echo of a footfall ,LOTR1,False
8600, hi watch wa nearly over when far off where he guessed that the western archway stood he fancied that he could see two pale point of light almost like luminou eye ,LOTR1,False
8601, i must have nearly fallen asleep on guard  he thought ,LOTR1,False
8602, i wa on the edge of a dream ,LOTR1,False
8603, he stood up and rubbed hi eye and remained standing peering into the dark until he wa relieved by legola ,LOTR1,False
8604, when he lay down he quickly went to sleep but it seemed to him that the dream went on: he heard whisper and saw the two pale point of light approaching slowly ,LOTR1,False
8605, he woke and found that the other were speaking softly near him and that a dim light wa falling on hi face ,LOTR1,False
8606, high up above the eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam; and acros the hall through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and distantly ,LOTR1,False
8607, said gandalf: for morning it i again at last ,LOTR1,False
8608, i wa right you see ,LOTR1,False
8609, we are high up on the east side of moria ,LOTR1,False
8610, before today i over we ought to find the great gate and see the water of mirrormere lying in the dimrill dale before u ,LOTR1,False
8611, i shall be glad  said gimli ,LOTR1,False
8612, i have looked on moria and it i very great but it ha become dark and dreadful; and we have found no sign of my kindred ,LOTR1,False
8613, i doubt now that balin ever came here ,LOTR1,False
8614, after they had breakfasted gandalf decided to go on again at once ,LOTR1,False
8615, we are tired but we shall rest better when we are outside  he said ,LOTR1,False
8616, i think that none of u will wish to spend another night in moria ,LOTR1,False
8617, which way shall we take ,LOTR1,False
8618,  maybe  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
8619, but i du not know yet exactly where we are ,LOTR1,False
8620, unl i am quite astray i gu that we are above and to the north of the great gates; and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them ,LOTR1,False
8621, the eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take; but before we make up our mind we ought to look about u ,LOTR1,False
8622, let u go toward that light in the north door ,LOTR1,False
8623, if we could find a window it would help but i fear that the light come only down deep shaft ,LOTR1,False
8624, following hi lead the company passed under the northern arch ,LOTR1,False
8625, they found themselve in a wide corridor ,LOTR1,False
8626, a they went along it the glimmer grew stronger and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right ,LOTR1,False
8627, it wa high and flat topped and the stone door wa still upon it hinge standing half open ,LOTR1,False
8628, beyond it wa a large square chamber ,LOTR1,False
8629, it wa dimly lit but to their eye after so long a time in the dark it seemed dazzlingly bright and they blinked a they entered ,LOTR1,False
8630, their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor and stumbled among thing lying in the doorway whose shape they could not at first make out ,LOTR1,False
8631, the chamber wa lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall; it slanted upward and far above a small square patch of blue sky could be seen ,LOTR1,False
8632, the light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the room: a single oblong block about two feet high upon which wa laid a great slab of white stone ,LOTR1,False
8633, it look like a tomb  muttered frodo and bent forward with a curiou sense of foreboding to look more closely at it ,LOTR1,False
8634, gandalf came quickly to hi side ,LOTR1,False
8635, on the slab rune were deeply graven: these are daeron rune such a were used of old in moria  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
8636, here i written in the tongue of men and dwarves: balin son of fundin lord of moria ,LOTR1,False
8637, he i dead then  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
8638, t feared it wa so ,LOTR1,False
8639, gimli cast hi hood over hi face ,LOTR1,False
8640, the bridge of khazad dym the company of the ring stood silent beside the tomb of balin ,LOTR1,False
8641, frodo thought of bilbo and hi long friendship with the dwarf and of balin visit to the shire long ago ,LOTR1,False
8642, in that dusty chamber in the mountain it seemed a thousand year ago and on the other side of the world ,LOTR1,False
8643, at length they stirred and looked up and began to search for anything that would give them tiding of balin fate or show what had become of hi folk ,LOTR1,False
8644, there wa another smaller door on the other side of the chamber under the shaft ,LOTR1,False
8645, by both the door they could now see that many bone were lying and among them were broken sword and axe head and cloven shield and helm some of the sword were crooked: ore scimitar with blackened blade ,LOTR1,False
8646, there were many recesse cut in the rock of the wall and in them were large iron bound chest of wood ,LOTR1,False
8647, all had been broken and plundered; but beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remain of a book ,LOTR1,False
8648, it had been slashed and stabbed and partly burned and it wa so stained with black and other dark mark like old blood that little of it could be read ,LOTR1,False
8649, gandalf lifted it carefully but the leave crackled and broke a he laid it on the slab ,LOTR1,False
8650, he pored over it for some time without speaking ,LOTR1,False
8651, frodo and gimli standing at hi side could see a he gingerly turned the leave that they were written by many different hand in rune both of moria and of dale and here and there in elvish script ,LOTR1,False
8652, at last gandalf looked up ,LOTR1,False
8653, it seem to be a record of the fortune of balin folk  he said ,LOTR1,False
8654, v i gu that it began with their coming to dimrill dale nigh on thirty year ago: the page seem to have number referring to the year after their arrival ,LOTR1,False
8655, the top page i marked one three so at least two are missing from the beginning ,LOTR1,False
8656, we drove out ore from the great gate and guard i think; the next word i blurred and burned; probably room we slew many in the bright i think sun in the dale ,LOTR1,False
8657, flui wa killed by an arrow ,LOTR1,False
8658, then there i a blur followed by flui under gras near mirror mere ,LOTR1,False
8659, the next line or two i cannot read ,LOTR1,False
8660, then come we have taken the twentyfirst hall of north end to dwell in ,LOTR1,False
8661, there i i cannot read what ,LOTR1,False
8662, then balin ha set up hi seat in the chamber of mazarbul ,LOTR1,False

8664, v i gu that i where we now stand ,LOTR1,False
8665, well i can read no more for a long way  said gandalf except the word gold and darin  axe and something helm ,LOTR1,False
8666, then balin i now lord of morici ,LOTR1,False

8668, after some star another hand begin and i can see we found truesilver and later the word wellforged and then something i have it ,LOTR1,False
8669, mithril; and the last two line uin to seek for the upper armourie of third deep something go westward a blur to hollin gate gandalf paused and set a few leave aside ,LOTR1,False
8670, there are several page of the same sort rather hastily written and much damaged he said; but i can make little of them in thi light ,LOTR1,False
8671, now there must be a number of leave missing because they begin to be numbered five the fifth year of the colony i suppose ,LOTR1,False
8672, no they are too cut and stained; i cannot read them ,LOTR1,False
8673, we might do better in the sunlight ,LOTR1,False
8674, here i something: a large bold hand using an elvish script ,LOTR1,False
8675, that would be ori hand  said gimli looking over the wizard arm ,LOTR1,False
8676, he could write well and speedily and often used the elvish character ,LOTR1,False
8677, i fear he had ill tiding to record in a fair hand  said gandalf ,LOTR1,False
8678, the first clear word i sorrow but the rest of the line i lost unl it end in estre ,LOTR1,False
8679, ye it must be yestre followed by day being the tenth of novembre balin lord of moria fell in dimrill dale ,LOTR1,False
8680, he went alone to look in mirror mere an ore shot him from behind a stone we slew the ore hut many more ,LOTR1,False

9082, the road now turned south and went quickly downward running out from between the arm of the dale ,LOTR1,False

9098, but it lie many mile away ,LOTR1,False

9101, sam cut wa burning like fire and hi head felt light ,LOTR1,False
9102, in spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill after the warm darkn of moria ,LOTR1,False
9103, frodo felt every step more painful and he gasped for breath ,LOTR1,False
9104, at last legola turned and seeing them now far behind he spoke to aragorn ,LOTR1,False

9110, there i will do what i can for you ,LOTR1,False
9111, soon afterward they came upon another stream that ran down from the west and joined it bubbling water with the hurrying silverlode ,LOTR1,False
9112, together they plunged over a fall of green hued stone and foamed down into a dell ,LOTR1,False
9113, about it stood fir tree short and bent and it side were steep and clothed with harts tongue and shrub of whortle berry ,LOTR1,False
9114, at the bottom there wa a level space through which the stream flowed noisily over shining pebble ,LOTR1,False

9130, we must have a look and see what the hammer and the anvil have done to you ,LOTR1,False
9131, i still marvel that you are alive at all ,LOTR1,False
9132, gently he stripped off frodo old jacket and worn tunic and gave a gasp of wonder ,LOTR1,False
9133, the silver corslet shimmered before hi eye like the light upon a rippling sea ,LOTR1,False
9134, carefully he took it off and held it up and the gem on it glittered like star and the sound of the shaken ring wa like the tinkle of rain in a pool ,LOTR1,False
9135, here a pretty hobbit skin to wrap an el ven princeling in ,LOTR1,False
9136, if it were known that hobbit had such hide all the hunter of middle earth would be riding to the shire ,LOTR1,False

9147, frodo left side also wa scored and bruised where he had been hurled against the wall ,LOTR1,False
9148, while the other set the food ready ,LOTR1,False
9149, aragorn bathed the hurt with water in which athela wa steeped ,LOTR1,False
9150, the pungent fragrance filled the dell and all those who stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened ,LOTR1,False

9158, they put out the fire and hid all trace of it ,LOTR1,False
9159, then climbing out of the dell they took to the road again ,LOTR1,False
9160, they had not gone far before the sun sank behind the westward height and great shadow crept down the mountain side ,LOTR1,False
9161, dusk veiled their feet and mist rose in the hollow ,LOTR1,False
9162, away in the east the evening light lay pale upon the dim land of distant plain and wood ,LOTR1,False
9163, sam and frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at a fair pace and with only one brief halt aragorn led the company on for nearly three more hour ,LOTR1,False
9164, there were many clear star hut the fast waning moon would not be seen till late ,LOTR1,False
9165, gimli and frodo were at the rear walking softly and not speaking listening for any sound upon the road behind ,LOTR1,False

9167, not a sound but the wind  he said ,LOTR1,False
9168, there are no goblin near or my ear are made of wood ,LOTR1,False
9169, it i to be hoped that the ore will be content with driving u from moria ,LOTR1,False
9170, and maybe that wa all their purpose and they had nothing else to do with us with the ring ,LOTR1,False
9171, though ore will often pursue foe for many league into the plain if they have a fallen captain to avenge ,LOTR1,False
9172, he looked at sting and the blade wa dull ,LOTR1,False
9173, yet he had heard something or thought he had ,LOTR1,False

9175, even now he heard it ,LOTR1,False
9176, there were two tiny gleam of light behind or for a moment he thought he saw them but at once they slipped aside and vanished ,LOTR1,False
9177, i thought i heard feet and i thought i saw a light like eye ,LOTR1,False
9178, i have thought so often since we first entered moria ,LOTR1,False
9179, gimli halted and stooped to the ground ,LOTR1,False
9180, i hear nothing but the night speech of plant and stone  he said ,LOTR1,False
9181, the other are out of sight ,LOTR1,False
9182, the night wind blew chill up the valley to meet them ,LOTR1,False
9183, before them a wide grey shadow loomed and they heard an endl rustle of leave like poplar in the breeze ,LOTR1,False
9184, we have come to the eave of the golden wood ,LOTR1,False
9185, ala that it i winter ,LOTR1,False
9186,  under the night the tree stood tall before them arched over the road and stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading bough ,LOTR1,False
9187, in the dim light of the star their stem were grey and their quivering leave a hint of fallow gold ,LOTR1,False
9188, glad i am to hear again the wind in the trees ,LOTR1,False

9191, if elve indeed still dwell here in the darkening world  said gimli ,LOTR1,False
9192, it i long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land whence we wandered in age long ago  said legola but we hear that lurien i not yet deserted for there i a secret power here that hold evil from the land ,LOTR1,False
9193, neverthel it folk are seldom seen and maybe they dwell now deep in the wood and far from the northern border ,LOTR1,False

9195, we must fend for ourselve tonight ,LOTR1,False
9196, we will go forward a short way until the tree are all about u and then we will turn aside from the path and seek a place to rest in ,LOTR1,False
9197, he stepped forward; but boromir stood irresolute and did not follow ,LOTR1,False
9198, i there no other way ,LOTR1,False
9199, what other fairer way would you desire ,LOTR1,False
9200, a plain road though it led through a hedge of sword  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
9201, by strange path ha thi company been led and so far to evil fortune ,LOTR1,False
9202, against my will we passed under the shade of moria to our los ,LOTR1,False
9203, and now we must enter the golden wood you say ,LOTR1,False
9204, but of that perilou land we have heard in gondor and it i said that few come out who once go in; and of that few none have escaped unscathed ,LOTR1,False
9205, say not unscathed but if you say unchanged then maybe you will speak the truth said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
9206, but lore wane in gondor boromir if in the city of those who once were wise they now speak evil of lothlurien ,LOTR1,False
9207, believe what you will there i no other way for u unl you would go back to moria gate or scale the pathl mountain or swim the great river all alone ,LOTR1,False
9208, perilou indeed  said aragorn fair and perilous; but only evil need fear it or those who bring some evil with them ,LOTR1,False
9209,  they had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came upon another stream flowing down swiftly from the tree clad slope that climbed back westward toward the mountain ,LOTR1,False
9210, they heard it splashing over a fall away among the shadow on their right ,LOTR1,False
9211, it dark hurrying water ran acros the path before them and joined the silverlode in a swirl of dim pool among the root of tree ,LOTR1,False
9212, of thi stream the silvan elve made many song long ago and still we sing them in the north remembering the rainbow on it fall and the golden flower that floated in it foam ,LOTR1,False
9213, all i dark now and the bridge of nimrodel i broken down ,LOTR1,False
9214, i will bathe my feet for it i said that the water i healing to the weary ,LOTR1,False
9215, he went forward and climbed down the deep cloven bank and stepped into the stream ,LOTR1,False
9216, the water i not deep ,LOTR1,False
9217, on the further bank we can rest and the sound of the falling water may bring u sleep and forgetfuln of grief ,LOTR1,False
9218, one by one they climbed down and followed legola ,LOTR1,False
9219, for a moment frodo stood near the brink and let the water flow over hi tired feet ,LOTR1,False
9220, it wa cold but it touch wa clean and a he went on and it mounted to hi knee he felt that the stain of travel and all wearin wa washed from hi limb ,LOTR1,False
9221, when all the company had crossed they sat and rested and ate a little food; and legola told them tale of lothlurien that the elve of mirkwood still kept in their heart of sunlight and starlight upon the meadow by the great river before the world wa grey ,LOTR1,False
9222, at length a silence fell and they heard the music of the waterfall running sweetly in the shadow ,LOTR1,False
9223, almost frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing mingled with the sound of the water ,LOTR1,False
9224, do you hear the voice of nimrodel ,LOTR1,False
9225, i will sing you a song of the maiden nimrodel who bore the same name a the stream beside which she lived lung ago ,LOTR1,False
9226, it i a fair song in our woodland tongue; but thi i how it run in the westron speech a some in rivendell now sing it ,LOTR1,False
9227, in a soft voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leave above them he began: an elven maid there wa of old a shining star by day: her mantle white wa hemmed with gold her shoe of silver grey ,LOTR1,False
9228, a star wa bound upon her brow a light wa on her hair a sun upon the golden bough in lurien the fair ,LOTR1,False
9229, her hair wa long her limb were white and fair she wa and free; and in the wind she went a light a leaf of linden tree ,LOTR1,False
9230, beside the fall of nimrodel by water clear and cool her voice a falling silver fell into the shining pool ,LOTR1,False
9231, where now she wander none can tell in sunlight or in shade; for lost of yore wa nimrodel and in the mountain strayed ,LOTR1,False
9232, the elven ship in haven grey beneath the mountain lee awaited her for many a day beside the roaring sea ,LOTR1,False
9233, a wind by night in northern land arose and loud it cried and drove the ship from elven strand acros the streaming tide ,LOTR1,False
9234, when dawn came dim the land wa lost the mountain sinking grey beyond the heaving wave that tossed their plume of blinding spray ,LOTR1,False
9235, amroth beheld the fading shore now low beyond the swell and cursed the faithl ship that bore him far from nimrodel ,LOTR1,False
9236, of old he wa an elven king a lord of tree and glen when golden were the bough in spring in fair lothlurien ,LOTR1,False
9237, from helm to sea they saw him leap a arrow from the string and dive into the water deep a mew upon the wing ,LOTR1,False
9238, the wind wa in hi flowing hair the foam about him shone; afar they saw him strong and fair go riding like a swan ,LOTR1,False
9239, but from the west ha come no word and on the hither shore no tiding elven folk have heard of amroth evermore ,LOTR1,False
9240, the voice of legola faltered and the song ceased ,LOTR1,False

9274,  he whispered to the other ,LOTR1,False
9275, do not move or speak ,LOTR1,False

9372, he drew out sting: it flashed and glittered like a blue flame and then slowly faded again and grew dull ,LOTR1,False
9373, in spite of the fading of hi sword the feeling of immediate danger did not leave frodo rather it grew stronger ,LOTR1,False
9374, he got up and crawled to the opening and peered down ,LOTR1,False
9375, he wa almost certain that he could hear stealthy movement at the tree foot far below ,LOTR1,False
9376, not elves; for the woodland folk were altogether noisel in their movement ,LOTR1,False
9377, then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing: and something seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree trunk ,LOTR1,False
9378, he stared down into the dark holding hi breath ,LOTR1,False
9379, something wa now climbing slowly and it breath came like a soft hissing through closed teeth ,LOTR1,False

9393, the three of u could not challenge a hundred so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voice leading them on into the wood ,LOTR1,False
9394, orophin ha now gone in haste back to our dwelling to warn our people ,LOTR1,False
9395, none of the ore will ever return out of lurien ,LOTR1,False

9401, looking through an opening on the south side of the flet frodo saw all the valley of the silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently in the breeze ,LOTR1,False
9402, the morning wa still young and cold when the company set out again guided now by haldir and hi brother rmil ,LOTR1,False
9403, frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree stem farewell  he said ,LOTR1,False
9404, it seemed to him that he would never hear again a running water so beautiful for ever blending it innumerable note in an endl changeful music ,LOTR1,False
9405, they went back to the path that still went on along the west side of the silverlode and for some way they followed it southward ,LOTR1,False
9406, there were the print of ore feet in the earth ,LOTR1,False
9407, but soon haldir turned aside into the tree and halted on the bank of the river under their shadow ,LOTR1,False
9408, there i one of my people yonder acros the stream  he said though you may not see him ,LOTR1,False
9409, he gave a call like the low whistle of a bird and out of a thicket of young tree an elf stepped clad in grey but with hi hood thrown back; hi hair glinted like gold in the morning sun ,LOTR1,False
9410, haldir skilfully cast over the stream a coil of grey rope and he caught it and bound the end about a tree near the bank ,LOTR1,False
9411, celebrant i already a strong stream here a you see  said haldir and it run both swift and deep and i very cold ,LOTR1,False

9419, when thi slender bridge had been made the company passed over some cautiously and slowly other more easily ,LOTR1,False
9420, of the hobbit pippin proved the best for he wa sure footed and he walked over quickly holding only with one hand; but he kept hi eye on the bank ahead and did not look down ,LOTR1,False
9421, sam shuffled along clutching hard and looking down into the pale eddying water a if it wa a chasm in the mountain ,LOTR1,False
9422, he breathed with relief when he wa safely acros ,LOTR1,False
9423, a my gaffer used to say ,LOTR1,False
9424, though he wa thinking of gardening not of roosting like a bird nor of trying to walk like a spider ,LOTR1,False
9425, not even my uncle andy ever did a trick like that ,LOTR1,False
9426,  when at length all the company wa gathered on the east bank of the silverlode the elve untied the rope and coiled two of them ,LOTR1,False
9427, rmil who had remained on the other side drew back the last one slung it on hi shoulder and with a wave of hi hand went away back to nimrodel to keep watch ,LOTR1,False

9624, they were clad wholly in white; and the hair of the lady wa of deep gold and the hair of the lord celeborn wa of silver long and bright; but no sign of age wa upon them unl it were in the depth of their eyes; for these were keen a lance in the starlight and yet profound the well of deep memory ,LOTR1,False
9625, haldir led frodo before them and the lord welcomed him in hi own tongue ,LOTR1,False
9626, the lady galadriel said no word but looked long upon hi face ,LOTR1,False

9649, but i cannot see him from afar unl he come within the fence of lothlurien: a grey mist i about him and the way of hi feet and of hi mind are hidden from me ,LOTR1,False
9650, gandalf the grey fell into shadow ,LOTR1,False

9660, tell u now the full tale ,LOTR1,False
9661,  said celeborn: then aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pas of caradhra and in the day that followed; and he spoke of balin and hi book and the fight in the chamber of mazarbul and the fire and the narrow bridge and the coming of the terror ,LOTR1,False
9662, an evil of the ancient world it seemed such a i have never seen before  said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
9663, it wa both a shadow and a flame strong and terrible ,LOTR1,False

9665, indeed i saw upon the bridge that which haunt our darkest dream number saw durin bane  said gimli in a low voice and dread wa in hi eye ,LOTR1,False
9666, we long have feared that under caradhra a terror slept ,LOTR1,False
9667, but had i known that the dwarve had stirred up thi evil in moria again number would have forbidden you to pas the northern border you and all that went with you ,LOTR1,False
9668, and if it were possible one would say that at the last gandalf fell from wisdom into folly going needlessly into the net of moria ,LOTR1,False
9669, he would be rash indeed that said that thing  said galadriel gravely ,LOTR1,False
9670, needl were none of the deed of gandalf in life ,LOTR1,False
9671, those that followed him knew not hi mind and cannot report hi full purpose ,LOTR1,False
9672, but however it may be with the guide the follower are blamel ,LOTR1,False
9673, do not repent of your welcome to the dwarf ,LOTR1,False

9676, she looked upon gimli who sat glowering and sad and she smiled ,LOTR1,False
9677, and the dwarf hearing the name given in hi own ancient tongue looked up and met her eyes; and it seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw there love and understanding ,LOTR1,False
9678, wonder came into hi face and then he smiled in answer ,LOTR1,False
9679, he rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf fashion saying: yet more fair i the living land of lurien and the lady galadriel i above all the jewel that lie beneath the earth ,LOTR1,False
9680,  there wa a silence ,LOTR1,False
9681, at length celeborn spoke again ,LOTR1,False
9682, i did not know that your plight wa so evil  he said ,LOTR1,False
9683, let gimli forget my harsh words: i spoke in the trouble of my heart ,LOTR1,False
9684, i will do what i can to aid you each according to hi wish and need but especially that one of the little folk who bear the burden ,LOTR1,False
9685, your quest i known to u  said galadriel looking at frodo ,LOTR1,False
9686, but we will not here speak of it more openly ,LOTR1,False
9687, yet not in vain will it prove maybe that you came to thi land seeking aid a gandalf himself plainly purposed ,LOTR1,False
9688, for the lord of the galadhrim i accounted the wisest of the elve of middle earth and a giver of gift beyond the power of king ,LOTR1,False
9689, he ha dwelt in the west since the day of dawn and i have dwelt with him year uncounted; for ere the fall of nargothrond or gondolin i passed over the mountain and together through age of the world we have fought the long defeat ,LOTR1,False
9690, i it wa who first summoned the white council ,LOTR1,False
9691, and if my design had not gone amis it would have been governed by gandalf the grey and then mayhap thing would have gone otherwise ,LOTR1,False
9692, but even now there i hope left ,LOTR1,False
9693, i will not give you counsel saying do thi or do that ,LOTR1,False
9694, for not in doing or contriving nor in choosing between thi course and another can i avail; but only in knowing what wa and i and in part also what shall be ,LOTR1,False
9695, but thi i will say to you: your quest stand upon the edge of a knife ,LOTR1,False
9696, stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all ,LOTR1,False
9697, yet hope remain while all the company i true ,LOTR1,False
9698, and with that word she held them with her eye and in silence looked searchingly at each of them in turn ,LOTR1,False
9699, none save legola and aragorn could long endure her glance ,LOTR1,False
9700, sam quickly blushed and hung hi head ,LOTR1,False
9701, at length the lady galadriel released them from her eye and she smiled ,LOTR1,False
9702, do not let your heart be troubled  she said ,LOTR1,False
9703, tonight you shall sleep in peace ,LOTR1,False
9704, then they sighed and felt suddenly weary a those who have been questioned long and deeply though no word had been spoken openly ,LOTR1,False
9705, you are worn with sorrow and much toil ,LOTR1,False
9706, even if your quest did not concern u closely you should have refuge in thi city until you were healed and refreshed ,LOTR1,False
9707, now you shall rest and we will not speak of your further road for a while ,LOTR1,False
9708, that night the company slept upon the ground much to the satisfaction of the hobbit ,LOTR1,False
9709, the elve spread for them a pavilion among the tree near the fountain and in it they laid soft couches; then speaking word of peace with fair elvish voice they left them ,LOTR1,False
9710, for a little while the traveller talked of their night before in the tree top and of their day journey and of the lord and lady; for they had not yet the heart to look further back ,LOTR1,False
9711, what did you blush for sam ,LOTR1,False
9712, anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience ,LOTR1,False
9713, i hope it wa nothing worse than a wicked plot to steal one of my blanket ,LOTR1,False
9714, i never thought no such thing  answered sam in no mood for jest ,LOTR1,False
9715, if you want to know i felt a if i hadnt got nothing on and i didnt like it ,LOTR1,False
9716, she seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what i would do if she gave me the chance of flying back home to the shire to a nice little hole with with a bit of garden of my own ,LOTR1,False
9717, that funny  said merry ,LOTR1,False
9718, almost exactly what i felt myself; only only well i dont think ill say any more  he ended lamely ,LOTR1,False
9719, all of them it seemed had fared alike: each had felt that he wa offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead and something that he greatly desired: clear before hi mind it lay and to get it he had only to turn aside from the road and leave the quest and the war against sauron to other ,LOTR1,False
9720, and it seemed to me too  said gimli that my choice would remain secret and known only to myself ,LOTR1,False
9721, to me it seemed exceedingly strange  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
9722, maybe it wa only a test and she thought to read our thought for her own good purpose; but almost i should have said that she wa tempting u and offering what she pretended to have the power to give ,LOTR1,False
9723, it need not be said that i refused to listen ,LOTR1,False
9724, the men of mina tirith are true to their word ,LOTR1,False
9725, but what he thought that the lady had offered him boromir did not tell ,LOTR1,False
9726, and a for frodo he would not speak though boromir pressed him with question ,LOTR1,False
9727, she held you long in her gaze ring bearer  he said ,LOTR1,False
9728, ye  said frodo; but whatever came into my mind then i will keep there ,LOTR1,False
9729, i do not feel too sure of thi elvish lady and her purpose ,LOTR1,False
9730, speak no evil of the lady galadriel ,LOTR1,False
9731, you know not what you say ,LOTR1,False
9732, there i in her and in thi land no evil unl a man bring it hither himself ,LOTR1,False
9733, then let him beware  ,LOTR1,False
9734, but tonight i shall sleep without fear for the first time since i left rivendell ,LOTR1,False
9735, and may i sleep deep and forget for a while my grief ,LOTR1,False
9736, i am weary in body and in heart ,LOTR1,False
9737, he cast himself down upon hi couch and fell at once into a long sleep ,LOTR1,False
9738, the other soon did the same and no sound or dream disturbed their slumber ,LOTR1,False
9739, when they woke they found that the light of day wa broad upon the lawn before the pavilion and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the sun ,LOTR1,False
9740, they remained some day in lothlurien so far a they could tell or remember ,LOTR1,False
9741, all the while that they dwelt there the sun shone clear save for a gentle rain that fell at time and passed away leaving all thing fresh and clean ,LOTR1,False
9742, the air wa cool and soft a if it were early spring yet they felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter ,LOTR1,False
9743, it seemed to them that they did little but eat and drink and rest and walk among the trees; and it wa enough ,LOTR1,False
9744, they had not seen the lord and lady again and they had little speech with the elven folk; for few of these knew or would use the westron tongue ,LOTR1,False
9745, haldir had bidden them farewell and gone back again to the fence of the north where great watch wa now kept since the tiding of moria that the company had brought ,LOTR1,False
9746, legola wa away much among the galadhrim and after the first night he did not sleep with the other companion though he returned to eat and talk with them ,LOTR1,False
9747, often he took gimli with him when he went abroad in the land and the other wondered at thi change ,LOTR1,False
9748, now a the companion sat or walked together they spoke of gandalf and all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their mind ,LOTR1,False
9749, a they were healed of hurt and wearin of body the grief of their los grew more keen ,LOTR1,False

9751, mithrandir mithrandir sang the elve o pilgrim grey ,LOTR1,False
9752, for so they loved to call him ,LOTR1,False
9753, but if legola wa with the company he would not interpret the song for them saying that he had not the skill and that for him the grief wa still too near a matter for tear and not yet for song ,LOTR1,False
9754, it wa frodo who first put something of hi sorrow into halting word ,LOTR1,False
9755, he wa seldom moved to make song or rhyme; even in ri vendell he had listened and had not sung himself though hi memory wa stored with many thing that other had made before him ,LOTR1,False
9756, but now a he sat beside the fountain in lurien and heard about him the voice of the elve hi thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to him; yet when he tried to repeat it to sam only snatche remained faded a a handful of withered leave ,LOTR1,False
9757, when evening in the shire wa grey hi footstep on the hill were heard; before the dawn he went away on journey long without a word ,LOTR1,False

9759, with dwarf and hobbit elve and men with mortal and immortal folk with bird on bough and beast in den in their own secret tongue he spoke ,LOTR1,False
9760, a deadly sword a healing hand a back that bent beneath it load; a trumpet voice a burning brand a weary pilgrim on the road ,LOTR1,False
9761, a lord of wisdom throned he sat swift in anger quick to laugh; an old man in a battered hat who leaned upon a thorny staff ,LOTR1,False
9762, he stood upon the bridge alone and fire and shadow both defied; hi staff wa broken on the stone in khazad dym hi wisdom died ,LOTR1,False
9763, why youll be beating mr bilbo next ,LOTR1,False
9764, no i am afraid not  said frodo ,LOTR1,False

9766, well mr frodo if you do have another go i hope youll say a word about hi firework  said sam ,LOTR1,False
9767, something like this: the finest rocket ever seen: they burst in star of blue and green or after thunder golden shower came falling like a rain of flower ,LOTR1,False

9779, now these folk arent wanderer or homel and seem a bit nearer to the like of us: they seem to belong here more even than flobbit do in the shire ,LOTR1,False
9780, whether theyve made the land or the land made them it hard to say if you take my meaning ,LOTR1,False
9781, nothing seem to be going on and nobody seem to want it to ,LOTR1,False
9782, if there any magic about it right down deep where i cant lay my hand on it in a manner of speaking ,LOTR1,False
9783, you can see and feel it everywhere  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
9784, well  said sam you cant see nobody working it ,LOTR1,False
9785, no firework like poor gandalf used to show ,LOTR1,False
9786, i wonder we dont see nothing of the lord and lady in all these day ,LOTR1,False

9800, i am afraid that only too true sam  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
9801, yet i hope very much that before we leave we shall see the lady of the elve again ,LOTR1,False
9802, even a he spoke they saw a if she came in answer to their word the lady galadriel approaching ,LOTR1,False
9803, tall and white and fair she walked beneath the tree ,LOTR1,False
9804, she spoke no word but beckoned to them ,LOTR1,False
9805, turning aside she led them toward the southern slope of the hill of cara galadhon and passing through a high green hedge they came into an enclosed garden ,LOTR1,False
9806, no tree grew there and it lay open to the sky ,LOTR1,False
9807, the evening star had risen and wa shining with white fire above the western wood ,LOTR1,False
9808, down a long flight of step the lady went into a deep green hollow through which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain on the hill ,LOTR1,False
9809, at the bottom upon a low pedestal carved like a branching tree stood a basin of silver wide and shallow and beside it stood a silver ewer ,LOTR1,False
9810, with water from the stream galadriel filled the basin to the brim and breathed on it and when the water wa still again she spoke ,LOTR1,False
9811, here i the mirror of galadriel  she said ,LOTR1,False

9814, what shall we look for and what shall we see ,LOTR1,False
9815,  asked frodo filled with awe ,LOTR1,False
9816, many thing i can command the mirror to reveal  she answered and to some i can show what they desire to see ,LOTR1,False
9817, but the mirror will also show thing unbidden and those are often stranger and more profitable than thing which we wish to behold ,LOTR1,False
9818, what you will see if you leave the mirror free to work i cannot tell ,LOTR1,False
9819, for it show thing that were and thing that are thing that yet may be ,LOTR1,False

9829, til have a peep lady if youre willing ,LOTR1,False

9834, but come you shall look and see what you may ,LOTR1,False
9835, do not touch the water ,LOTR1,False

9837, the water looked hard and dark ,LOTR1,False
9838, star were reflected in it ,LOTR1,False
9839, there only star a i thought  he said ,LOTR1,False

9842, there wa sun shining and the branche of tree were waving and tossing in the wind ,LOTR1,False
9843, but before sam could make up hi mind what it wa that he saw the light faded; and now he thought he saw frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff ,LOTR1,False
9844, then he seemed to see himself going along a dim passage and climbing an endl winding stair ,LOTR1,False
9845, it came to him suddenly that he wa looking urgently for something but what it wa he did not know ,LOTR1,False
9846, like a dream the vision shifted and went back and he saw the tree again ,LOTR1,False
9847, but thi time they were not so close and he could see what wa going on: they were not waving in the wind they were falling crashing to the ground ,LOTR1,False
9848, cried sam in an outraged voice ,LOTR1,False
9849, there that ted sandyman a cutting down tree a he shouldnt ,LOTR1,False

9854, black smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the mirror ,LOTR1,False
9855, there some devilry at work in the shire  he said ,LOTR1,False
9856, elrond knew what he wa about when he wanted to send mr merry back ,LOTR1,False
9857, then suddenly sam gave a cry and sprang away ,LOTR1,False
9858, i cant stay here  he said wildly ,LOTR1,False
9859, theyve dug up bagshot row and there the poor old gaffer going down the hill with hi bit of thing on a barrow ,LOTR1,False
9860,  you cannot go home alone  said the lady ,LOTR1,False

9865, sam sat on the ground and put hi head in hi hand ,LOTR1,False
9866, i wish i had never come here and i dont want to see no more magic  he said and fell silent ,LOTR1,False
9867, after a moment he spoke again thickly a if struggling with tear ,LOTR1,False
9868, no ill go home by the long road with mr frodo or not at all  he said ,LOTR1,False
9869, but i hope i do get back some day ,LOTR1,False

9871,  do you now wish to look frodo ,LOTR1,False

9873, you did not wish to see elf magic and were content ,LOTR1,False
9874, do you advise me to look ,LOTR1,False
9875, i do not counsel you one way or the other ,LOTR1,False
9876, i am not a counsellor ,LOTR1,False
9877, you may learn something and whether what you see be fair or evil that may be profitable and yet it may not ,LOTR1,False
9878, seeing i both good and perilou ,LOTR1,False
9879, yet i think frodo that you have courage and wisdom enough for the venture or i would not have brought you here ,LOTR1,False
9880,  i will look  said frodo and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water ,LOTR1,False
9881, at once the mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land ,LOTR1,False
9882, mountain loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky ,LOTR1,False
9883, a long grey road wound back out of sight ,LOTR1,False
9884, far away a figure came slowly down the road faint and small at first but growing larger and clearer a it approached ,LOTR1,False
9885, suddenly frodo realized that it reminded him of gandalf ,LOTR1,False
9886, he almost called aloud the wizard name and then he saw that the figure wa clothed not in grey but in white in a white that shone faintly in the dusk; and in it hand there wa a white staff ,LOTR1,False
9887, the head wa so bowed that he could see no face and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and went out of the mirror view ,LOTR1,False
9888, doubt came into frodo mind: wa thi a vision of gandalf on one of hi many lonely journey long ago or wa it saruman ,LOTR1,False
9889, brief and small but very vivid he caught a glimpse of bilbo walking restlessly about hi room ,LOTR1,False
9890, the table wa littered with disordered papers; rain wa beating on the window ,LOTR1,False
9891, then there wa a pause and after it many swift scene followed that frodo in some way knew to be part of a great history in which he had become involved ,LOTR1,False
9892, the mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before but knew at once: the sea ,LOTR1,False
9893, the sea rose and raged in a great storm ,LOTR1,False
9894, then he saw against the sun sinking blood red into a wrack of cloud the black outline of a tall ship with torn sail riding up out of the west ,LOTR1,False
9895, then a wide river flowing through a populou city ,LOTR1,False
9896, then a white fortr with seven tower ,LOTR1,False
9897, and then again a ship with black sail but now it wa morning again and the water rippled with light and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun ,LOTR1,False
9898, a smoke a of fire and battle arose and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey mist; and into the mist a small ship passed away twinkling with light ,LOTR1,False
9899, it vanished and frodo sighed and prepared to draw away ,LOTR1,False
9900, but suddenly the mirror went altogether dark a dark a if a hole had opened in the world of sight and frodo looked into emptin ,LOTR1,False
9901, in the black abys there appeared a single eye that slowly grew until it filled nearly all the mirror ,LOTR1,False
9902, so terrible wa it that frodo stood rooted unable to cry out or to withdraw hi gaze ,LOTR1,False
9903, the eye wa rimmed with fire but wa itself glazed yellow a a cat watchful and intent and the black slit of it pupil opened on a pit a window into nothing ,LOTR1,False
9904, then the eye began to rove searching thi way and that; and frodo knew with certainty and horror that among the many thing that it sought he himself wa one ,LOTR1,False
9905, but he also knew that it could not see him not yet not unl he willed it ,LOTR1,False
9906, the ring that hung upon it chain about hi neck grew heavy heavier than a great stone and hi head wa dragged downward ,LOTR1,False
9907, the mirror seemed to be growing hot and curl of steam were rising from the water ,LOTR1,False
9908, do not touch the water ,LOTR1,False
9909, said the lady galadriel softly ,LOTR1,False
9910, the vision faded and frodo found that he wa looking at the cool star twinkling in the silver basin ,LOTR1,False
9911, he stepped back shaking all over and looked at the lady ,LOTR1,False
9912, v i know what it wa that you last saw  she said; for that i also in my mind ,LOTR1,False
9913, but do not think that only by singing amid the tree nor even by the slender arrow of elven bow i thi land of lothlurien maintained and defended against it enemy ,LOTR1,False
9914, i say to you frodo that even a i speak to you i perceive the dark lord and know hi mind or all of hi mind that concern the elve ,LOTR1,False
9915, and he grope ever to see me and my thought ,LOTR1,False
9916, but still the door i closed ,LOTR1,False
9917,  she lifted up her white arm and spread out her hand toward the east in a gesture of rejection and denial ,LOTR1,False
9918, edrendil the evening star most beloved of the elve shone clear above ,LOTR1,False
9919, so bright wa it that the figure of the elven lady cast a dim shadow on the ground ,LOTR1,False
9920, it ray glanced upon a ring about her finger; it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light and a white stone in it twinkled a if the even star had come down to rest upon her hand ,LOTR1,False
9921, frodo gazed at the ring with awe; for suddenly it seemed to him that he understood ,LOTR1,False
9922, ye  she said divining hi thought it i not permitted to speak of it and elrond could not do so ,LOTR1,False
9923, but it cannot be hidden from the ring bearer and one who ha seen the eye ,LOTR1,False
9924, verily it i in the land of lurien upon the finger of galadriel that one of the three remain ,LOTR1,False
9925, thi i nenya the ring of adamant and i am it keeper ,LOTR1,False
9926, he suspect but he doe not know not yet ,LOTR1,False
9927, do you not see now wherefore your coming i to u a the footstep of doom ,LOTR1,False
9928, for if you fail then we are laid bare to the enemy ,LOTR1,False
9929, yet if you succeed then our power i diminished and lothlurien will fade and the tide of time will sweep it away ,LOTR1,False
9930, we must depart into the west or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and cave slowly to forget and to be forgotten ,LOTR1,False
9931, and what do you wish ,LOTR1,False
9932,  he said at last ,LOTR1,False
9933, that what should be shall be  she answered ,LOTR1,False
9934, the love of the elve for their land and their work i deeper than the deep of the sea and their regret i undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged ,LOTR1,False
9935, yet they will cast all away rather than submit to sauron: for they know him now ,LOTR1,False
9936, for the fate of lothlurien you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own task ,LOTR1,False
9937, yet i could wish were it of any avail that the one ring had never been wrought or had remained for ever lost ,LOTR1,False
9938, you are wise and fearl and fair lady galadriel  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
9939, i will give you the one ring if you ask for it ,LOTR1,False
9940, it i too great a matter for me ,LOTR1,False
9941, galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh ,LOTR1,False
9942, wise the lady galadriel may be  she said yet here she ha met her match in courtesy ,LOTR1,False
9943, gently are you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting ,LOTR1,False
9944, you begin to see with a keen eye ,LOTR1,False
9945, i do not deny that my heart ha greatly desired to ask what you offer ,LOTR1,False
9946, for many long year i had pondered what i might do should the great ring come into my hand and behold ,LOTR1,False
9947, it wa brought within my grasp ,LOTR1,False
9948, the evil that wa devised long ago work on in many way whether sauron himself stand or fall ,LOTR1,False
9949, would not that have been a noble deed to set to the credit of hi ring if i had taken it by force or fear from my guest ,LOTR1,False
9950, and now at last it come ,LOTR1,False
9951, you will give me the ring freely ,LOTR1,False
9952, in place of the dark lord you will set up a queen ,LOTR1,False
9953, and i shall not be dark but beautiful and terrible a the morning and the night ,LOTR1,False
9954, fair a the sea and the sun and the snow upon the mountain ,LOTR1,False
9955, dreadful a the storm and the lightning  ,LOTR1,False
9956, stronger than the foundation of the earth ,LOTR1,False
9957, all shall love me and despair ,LOTR1,False
9958,  she lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a great light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark ,LOTR1,False
9959, she stood before frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement and beautiful beyond enduring terrible and worshipful ,LOTR1,False
9960, then she let her hand fall and the light faded and suddenly she laughed again and lo ,LOTR1,False
9961, she wa shrunken: a slender elf woman clad in simple white whose gentle voice wa soft and sad ,LOTR1,False
9962, i pas the test  she said ,LOTR1,False
9963, i will diminish and go into the west and remain galadriel ,LOTR1,False
9964, they stood for a long while in silence ,LOTR1,False
9965, at length the lady spoke again ,LOTR1,False
9966, in the morning you must depart for now we have chosen and the tide of fate are flowing ,LOTR1,False
9967, i would ask one thing before we go  said frodo a thing which i often meant to ask gandalf in rivendell ,LOTR1,False
9968, i am permitted to wear the one ring: why cannot i see all the other and know the thought of those that wear them ,LOTR1,False
9969,  you have not tried  she said ,LOTR1,False
9970, only thrice have you set the ring upon your finger since you knew what you possessed ,LOTR1,False
9971, did not gandalf tell you that the ring give power according to the measure of each possessor ,LOTR1,False
9972, before you could use that power you would need to become far stronger and to train your will to the domination of other ,LOTR1,False
9973, yet even so a ring bearer and a one that ha borne it on finger and seen that which i hidden your sight i grown keener ,LOTR1,False
9974, you have perceived my thought more clearly than many that are accounted wise ,LOTR1,False
9975, you saw the eye of him that hold the seven and the nine ,LOTR1,False
9976, and did you not see and recognize the ring upon my finger ,LOTR1,False
9977, did you see my ring ,LOTR1,False
9978,  she asked turning again to sam ,LOTR1,False
9979, no lady  he answered ,LOTR1,False
9980, to tell you the truth i wondered what you were talking about ,LOTR1,False
9981, i saw a star through your finger ,LOTR1,False
9982, but if youll pardon my speaking out i think my master wa right ,LOTR1,False
9983, i wish youd take hi ring ,LOTR1,False
9984, youd put thing to right ,LOTR1,False
9985, youd stop them digging up the gaffer and turning him adrift ,LOTR1,False
9986, youd make some folk pay for their dirty work ,LOTR1,False
9987, i would  she said ,LOTR1,False
9988, that i how it would begin ,LOTR1,False
9989, but it would not stop with that alas ,LOTR1,False
9990, we will not speak more of it ,LOTR1,False
9991, farewell to lurien that night the company wa again summoned to the chamber of celeborn and there the lord and lady greeted them with fair word ,LOTR1,False
9992, at length celeborn spoke of their departure ,LOTR1,False
9993, now i the time  he said when those who wish to continue the quest must harden their heart to leave thi land ,LOTR1,False
9994, those who no longer wish to go forward may remain here for a while ,LOTR1,False
9995, but whether they stay or go none can be sure of peace ,LOTR1,False
9996, for we are come now to the edge of doom ,LOTR1,False
9997, here those who wish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the way of the world lie open again or we summon them to the last need of lurien ,LOTR1,False
9998, then they may return to their own land or else go to the long home of those that fall in battle ,LOTR1,False
9999, they all resolved to go forward  said galadriel looking in their eye ,LOTR1,False
10000, a for me  said boromir my way home lie onward and not back ,LOTR1,False
10001, that i true  said celeborn but i all thi company going with you to mina tirith ,LOTR1,False

10003, beyond lothlurien i do not know what gandalf intended to do ,LOTR1,False
10004, indeed i do not think that even he had any clear purpose ,LOTR1,False
10005, maybe not  said celeborn yet when you leave thi land you can no longer forget the great river ,LOTR1,False
10006, a some of you know well it cannot be crossed by traveller with baggage between lurien and gondor save by boat ,LOTR1,False
10007, and are not the bridge of osgiliath broken down and all the landing held now by the enemy ,LOTR1,False
10008, on which side will you journey ,LOTR1,False
10009, the way to mina tirith lie upon thi side upon the west; but the straight road of the quest lie east of the river upon the darker shore ,LOTR1,False
10010, which shore will you now take ,LOTR1,False
10011,  if my advice i heeded it will be the western shore and the way to mina tirith  answered boromir ,LOTR1,False
10012, but i am not the leader of the company ,LOTR1,False
10013, the other said nothing and aragorn looked doubtful and troubled ,LOTR1,False
10014, i see that you do not yet know what to do  said celeborn ,LOTR1,False
10015, it i not my part to choose for you; but i will help you a i may ,LOTR1,False
10016, there are some among you who can handle boats: legola whose folk know the swift forest river; and boromir of gondor; and aragorn the traveller ,LOTR1,False
10017, not all of u look on boat a wild horse ,LOTR1,False
10018, my people live by the bank of the brandywine ,LOTR1,False
10019, that i well  said celeborn ,LOTR1,False
10020, then i will furnish your company with boat ,LOTR1,False
10021, they must be small and light for if you go far by water there are place where you will be forced to carry them ,LOTR1,False
10022, you will come to the rapid of sarn gebir and maybe at last to the great fall of rauro where the river thunder down from nen hithoel; and there are other peril ,LOTR1,False
10023, boat may make your journey l toilsome for awhile ,LOTR1,False
10024, yet they will not give you counsel: in the end you must leave them and the river and turn west or east ,LOTR1,False
10025, aragorn thanked celeborn many time ,LOTR1,False
10026, the gift of boat comforted him much not least because there would now be no need to decide hi course for some day ,LOTR1,False
10027, the other too looked more hopeful ,LOTR1,False
10028, whatever peril lay ahead it seemed better to float down the broad tide of anduin to meet them than to plod forward with bent back ,LOTR1,False
10029, only sam wa doubtful: he at any rate still thought boat a bad a wild horse or worse and not all the danger that he had survived made him think better of them ,LOTR1,False
10030, all shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before noon tomorrow  said celeborn ,LOTR1,False
10031, i will send my people to you in the morning to help you make ready for the journey ,LOTR1,False
10032, now we will wish you all a fair night and untroubled sleep ,LOTR1,False
10033, do not trouble your heart overmuch with thought of the road tonight ,LOTR1,False
10034, maybe the path that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet though you do not see them ,LOTR1,False
10035,  the company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion ,LOTR1,False
10036, legola went with them for thi wa to be their last night in lothlurien and in spite of the word of galadriel they wished to take counsel together ,LOTR1,False
10037, for a long time they debated what they should do and how it would be best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the ring: but they came to no decision ,LOTR1,False
10038, it wa plain that most of them desired to go first to mina tirith and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the enemy ,LOTR1,False
10039, they would have been willing to follow a leader over the river and into the shadow of mordor; but frodo spoke no word and aragorn wa still divided in hi mind ,LOTR1,False
10040, hi own plan while gandalf remained with them had been to go with boromir and with hi sword help to deliver gondor ,LOTR1,False
10041, for he believed that the message of the dream wa a summon and that the hour had come at last when the heir of elendil should come forth and strive with sauron for the mastery ,LOTR1,False
10042, but in moria the burden of gandalf had been laid on him; and he knew that he could not now forsake the ring if frodo refused in the end to go with boromir ,LOTR1,False
10043, and yet what help could he or any of the company give to frodo save to walk blindly with him into the darkness ,LOTR1,False
10044, i shall go to mina tirith alone if need be for it i my duty  said boromir; and after that he wa silent for a while sitting with hi eye fixed on frodo a if he wa trying to read the halfling thought ,LOTR1,False
10045, at length he spoke again softly a if he wa debating with himself ,LOTR1,False
10046, if you wish only to destroy the ring  he said then there i little use in war and weapons; and the men of mina tirith cannot help ,LOTR1,False
10047, but if you wish to destroy the armed might of the dark lord then it i folly to go without force into hi domain; and folly to throw away ,LOTR1,False
10048, he paused suddenly a if he had become aware that he wa speaking hi thought aloud ,LOTR1,False
10049, it would be folly to throw live away i mean  he ended ,LOTR1,False
10050, it i a choice between defending a strong place and walking openly into the arm of death ,LOTR1,False
10051, at least that i how i see it ,LOTR1,False
10052, frodo caught something new and strange in boromir glance and he looked hard at him ,LOTR1,False
10053, plainly boromir thought wa different from hi final word ,LOTR1,False
10054, it would be folly to throw away: what ,LOTR1,False
10055, he had said something like thi at the council but then he had accepted the correction of elrond ,LOTR1,False
10056, frodo looked at aragorn but he seemed deep in hi own thought and made no sign that he had heeded boromir word ,LOTR1,False
10057, and so their debate ended ,LOTR1,False
10058, merry and pippin were already asleep and sam wa nodding ,LOTR1,False
10059, the night wa growing old ,LOTR1,False
10060, in the morning a they were beginning to pack their slender good elve that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gift of food and clothing for the journey ,LOTR1,False
10061, the food wa mostly in the form of very thin cake made of a meal that wa baked a light brown on the outside and inside wa the colour of cream ,LOTR1,False
10062, gimli took up one of the cake and looked at it with a doubtful eye ,LOTR1,False
10063, cram  he said under hi breath a he broke off a crisp corner and nibbled at it ,LOTR1,False
10064, hi expression quickly changed and he ate all the rest of the cake with relish ,LOTR1,False
10065, you have eaten enough already for a long day march ,LOTR1,False
10066, i thought it wa only a kind of cram such a the dale men make for journey in the wild  said the dwarf ,LOTR1,False
10067, so it i  they answered ,LOTR1,False
10068, but we call it lemba or waybread and it i more strengthening than any food made by men and it i more pleasant than cram by all account ,LOTR1,False
10069, indeed it i  said gimli ,LOTR1,False
10070, why it i better than the honey cake of the beorning and that i great praise for the beorning are the best baker that i know of; but they are none too willing to deal out their cake to traveller in these day ,LOTR1,False
10071,  all the same we bid you spare the food  they said ,LOTR1,False
10072, eat little at a time and only at need ,LOTR1,False
10073, for these thing are given to serve you when all else fail ,LOTR1,False
10074, the cake will keep sweet for many many day if they are unbroken and left in their leaf wrapping a we have brought them ,LOTR1,False
10075, one will keep a traveller on hi feet for a day of long labour even if he be one of the tall men of mina tirith ,LOTR1,False
10076, the elve next unwrapped and gave to each of the company the clothe they had brought ,LOTR1,False
10077, for each they had provided a hood and cloak made according to hi size of the light but warm silken stuff that the galadhrim wove ,LOTR1,False
10078, it wa hard to say of what colour they were: grey with the hue of twilight under the tree they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved or set in another light they were green a shadowed leave or brown a fallow field by night dusk silver a water under the star ,LOTR1,False
10079, each cloak wa fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver ,LOTR1,False
10080,  asked pippin looking at them with wonder ,LOTR1,False
10081, i do not know what you mean by that  answered the leader of the elve ,LOTR1,False
10082, they are fair garment and the web i good for it wa made in thi land ,LOTR1,False
10083, they are elvish robe certainly if that i what you mean ,LOTR1,False
10084, leaf and branch water and stone: they have the hue and beauty of all these thing under the twilight of lurien that we love; for we put the thought of all that we love into all that we make ,LOTR1,False
10085, yet they are garment not armour and they will not turn shaft or blade ,LOTR1,False
10086, but they should serve you well: they are light to wear and warm enough or cool enough at need ,LOTR1,False
10087, and you will find them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eye whether you walk among the stone or the tree ,LOTR1,False
10088, you are indeed high in the favour of the lady ,LOTR1,False
10089, for she herself and her maiden wove thi stuff; and never before have we clad stranger in the garb of our own people ,LOTR1,False
10090, after their morning meal the company said farewell to the lawn by the fountain ,LOTR1,False
10091, their heart were heavy; for it wa a fair place and it had become like home to them though they could not count the day and night that they had passed there ,LOTR1,False
10092, a they stood for a moment looking at the white water in the sunlight haldir came walking toward them over the green gras of the glade ,LOTR1,False
10093, frodo greeted him with delight ,LOTR1,False
10094, i have returned from the northern fence  said the elf and i am sent now to be your guide again ,LOTR1,False
10095, the dimrill dale i full of vapour and cloud of smoke and the mountain are troubled ,LOTR1,False
10096, there are noise in the deep of the earth ,LOTR1,False
10097, if any of you had thought of returning northward to your home you would not have been able to pas that way ,LOTR1,False
10098, your path now goe south ,LOTR1,False
10099, a they walked through cara galadhon the green way were empty; but in the tree above them many voice were murmuring and singing ,LOTR1,False
10100, at last haldir led them down the southward slope of the hill and they came again to the great gate hung with lamp and to the white bridge; and so they passed out and left the city of the elve ,LOTR1,False
10101, then they turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a deep thicket of mallorn tree and passed on winding through rolling woodland of silver shadow leading them ever down southward and eastward toward the shore of the river ,LOTR1,False
10102, they had gone some ten mile and noon wa at hand when they came on a high green wall ,LOTR1,False
10103, passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the tree ,LOTR1,False
10104, before them lay a long lawn of shining gras studded with golden elanor that glinted in the sun ,LOTR1,False
10105, the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright margins: on the right and west the silverlode flowed glittering; on the left and east the great river rolled it broad water deep and dark ,LOTR1,False
10106, on the further shore the woodland still marched on southward a far a the eye could see but all the bank were bleak and bare ,LOTR1,False
10107, no mallorn lifted it gold hung bough beyond the land of lurien ,LOTR1,False
10108, on the bank of the silverlode at some distance up from the meeting of the stream there wa a hythe of white stone and white wood ,LOTR1,False
10109, by it were moored many boat and barge ,LOTR1,False
10110, some were brightly painted and shone with silver and gold and green but most were either white or grey ,LOTR1,False
10111, three small grey boat had been made ready for the traveller and in these the elve stowed their good ,LOTR1,False
10112, and they added also coil of rope three to each boat ,LOTR1,False
10113, slender they looked but strong silken to the touch grey of hue like the elven cloak ,LOTR1,False
10114,  asked sam handling one that lay upon the greensward ,LOTR1,False
10115,  answered an elf from the boat ,LOTR1,False
10116, never travel far without a rope ,LOTR1,False
10117, and one that i long and strong and light ,LOTR1,False
10118, they may be a help in many need ,LOTR1,False
10119, you dont need to tell me that ,LOTR1,False
10120, i came without any and ive been worried ever since ,LOTR1,False
10121, but i wa wondering what these were made of knowing a bit about rope making: it in the family a you might say ,LOTR1,False
10122, they are made of hithlain  said the elf but there i no time now to instruct you in the art of their making ,LOTR1,False
10123, had we known that thi craft delighted you we could have taught you much ,LOTR1,False
10124, unl you should at some time return hither you must be content with our gift ,LOTR1,False
10125, may it serve you well  ,LOTR1,False
10126, all i now ready for you ,LOTR1,False
10127, but take care at first ,LOTR1,False
10128,  said the other elve ,LOTR1,False
10129, these boat are light built and they are crafty and unlike the boat of other folk ,LOTR1,False
10130, they will not sink lade them a you will; but they are wayward if mishandled ,LOTR1,False
10131, it would be wise if you accustomed yourselve to stepping in and out here where there i a landing place before you set off downstream ,LOTR1,False
10132, the company wa arranged in thi way: aragorn frodo and sam were in one boat; boromir merry and pippin in another; and in the third were legola and gimli who had now become fast friend ,LOTR1,False
10133, in thi last boat most of the good and pack were stowed ,LOTR1,False
10134, the boat were moved and steered with short handled paddle that had broad leaf shaped blade ,LOTR1,False
10135, when all wa ready aragorn led them on a trial up the silverlode ,LOTR1,False
10136, the current wa swift and they went forward slowly ,LOTR1,False
10137, sam sat in the bow clutching the side and looking back wistfully to the shore ,LOTR1,False
10138, the sunlight glittering on the water dazzled hi eye ,LOTR1,False
10139, a they passed beyond the green field of the tongue the tree drew down to the river brink ,LOTR1,False
10140, here and there golden leave tossed and floated on the rippling stream ,LOTR1,False
10141, the air wa very bright and still and there wa a silence except for the high distant song of lark ,LOTR1,False
10142, they turned a sharp bend in the river and there sailing proudly down the stream toward them they saw a swan of great size ,LOTR1,False
10143, the water rippled on either side of the white breast beneath it curving neck ,LOTR1,False
10144, it beak shone like burnished gold and it eye glinted like jet set in yellow stones; it huge white wing were half lifted ,LOTR1,False
10145, a music came down the river a it drew nearer; and suddenly they perceived that it wa a ship wrought and carved with elven skill in the liken of a bird ,LOTR1,False
10146, two elve clad in white steered it with black paddle ,LOTR1,False
10147, in the midst of the vessel sat celeborn and behind him stood galadriel tall and white; a circlet of golden flower wa in her hair and in her hand she held a harp and she sang ,LOTR1,False
10148, sad and sweet wa the sound of her voice in the cool clear air: i sang of leave of leave of gold and leave of gold there grew: of wind i sang a wind there came and in the branche blew ,LOTR1,False
10149, beyond the sun beyond the moon the foam wa on the sea and by the strand of ilmarin there grew a golden tree ,LOTR1,False
10150, beneath the star of ever eve in eldamar it shone in eldamar beside the wall of elven tirion ,LOTR1,False
10151, there long the golden leave have grown upon the branching year while here beyond the sundering sea now fall the elven tear ,LOTR1,False
10152, the winter come the bare and leafl day; the leave are falling in the stream the river flow away ,LOTR1,False
10153, too long i have dwelt upon thi hither shore and in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor ,LOTR1,False
10154, but if of ship i now should sing what ship would come to me what ship would bear me ever back acros so wide a sea ,LOTR1,False
10155, aragorn stayed hi boat a the swan ship drew alongside ,LOTR1,False
10156, the lady ended her song and greeted them ,LOTR1,False
10157, we have come to bid you our last farewell  she said and to speed you with blessing from our land ,LOTR1,False
10158, though you have been our guest  said celeborn you have not yet eaten with u and we bid you therefore to a parting feast here between the flowing water that will bear you far from lurien ,LOTR1,False
10159, the swan passed on slowly to the hythe and they turned their boat and followed it ,LOTR1,False
10160, there in the last end of egladil upon the green gras the parting feast wa held; but frodo ate and drank little heeding only the beauty of the lady and her voice ,LOTR1,False
10161, she seemed no longer perilou or terrible nor filled with hidden power ,LOTR1,False
10162, already she seemed to him a by men of later day elve still at time are seen: present and yet remote a living vision of that which ha already been left far behind by the flowing stream of time ,LOTR1,False
10163, after they had eaten and drunk sitting upon the gras celeborn spoke to them again of their journey and lifting hi hand he pointed south to the wood beyond the tongue ,LOTR1,False
10164, a you go down the water  he said you will find that the tree will fail and you will come to a barren country ,LOTR1,False
10165, there the river flow in stony vale amid high moor until at last after many league it come to the tall island of the tindrock that we call tol brandir ,LOTR1,False
10166, there it cast it arm about the steep shore of the isle and fall then with a great noise and smoke over the cataract of rauro down into the nindalf the wetwang a it i called in your tongue ,LOTR1,False
10167, that i a wide region of sluggish fen where the stream become tortuou and much divided ,LOTR1,False
10168, there the entwash flow in by many mouth from the forest of fangorn in the west ,LOTR1,False
10169, about that stream on thi side of the great river lie rohan ,LOTR1,False
10170, on the further side are the bleak hill of the emyn muil ,LOTR1,False
10171, the wind blow from the east there for they look out over the dead marshe and the noman land to cirith gorgor and the black gate of mordor ,LOTR1,False
10172, boromir and any that go with him seeking mina tirith will do well to leave the great river above rauro and cros the entwash before it find the marshe ,LOTR1,False
10173, yet they should not go too far up that stream nor risk becoming entangled in the forest of fangorn ,LOTR1,False
10174, that i a strange land and i now little known ,LOTR1,False
10175, but boromir and aragorn doubtl do not need thi warning ,LOTR1,False
10176, indeed we have heard of fangorn in mina tirith  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
10177, but what i have heard seem to me for the most part old wives tale such a we tell to our children ,LOTR1,False
10178, all that lie north of rohan i now to u so far away that fancy can wander freely there ,LOTR1,False
10179, of old fangorn lay upon the border of our realm; but it i now many live of men since any of u visited it to prove or disprove the legend that have come down from distant year ,LOTR1,False
10180, i have myself been at while in rohan but i have never crossed it northward ,LOTR1,False
10181, when i wa sent out a a messenger i passed through the gap by the skirt of the white mountain and crossed the isen and the grey flood into northerland ,LOTR1,False
10182, a long and wearisome journey ,LOTR1,False
10183, four hundred league i reckoned it and it took me many months; for i lost my horse at tharbad at the fording of the greyflood ,LOTR1,False
10184, after that journey and the road i have trodden with thi company i do not much doubt that i shall find a way through rohan and fangorn too if need be ,LOTR1,False
10185, then i need say no more  said celeborn ,LOTR1,False
10186, but do not despise the lore that ha come down from distant years; for oft it may chance that old wive keep in memory word of thing that once were needful for the wise to know ,LOTR1,False
10187, now galadriel rose from the gras and taking a cup from one of her maiden she filled it with white mead and gave it to celeborn ,LOTR1,False
10188, now it i time to drink the cup of farewell  she said ,LOTR1,False
10189, drink lord of the galadhrim ,LOTR1,False
10190, and let not your heart be sad though night must follow noon and already our evening draweth nigh ,LOTR1,False
10191, then she brought the cup to each of the company and bade them drink and farewell ,LOTR1,False
10192, but when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the gras and chair were set for her and for celeborn ,LOTR1,False
10193, her maiden stood silent about her and a while she looked upon her guest ,LOTR1,False
10194, at last she spoke again ,LOTR1,False
10195, we have drunk the cup of parting  she said and the shadow fall between u ,LOTR1,False
10196, but before you go i have brought in my ship gift which the lord and lady of the galadhrim now offer you in memory of lothlurien ,LOTR1,False
10197, then she called to each in turn ,LOTR1,False
10198, here i the gift of celeborn and galadriel to the leader of your company  she said to aragorn and she gave him a sheath that had been made to fit hi sword ,LOTR1,False
10199, it wa overlaid with a tracery of flower and leave wrought of silver and gold and on it were set in elven rune formed of many gem the name andril and the lineage of the sword ,LOTR1,False
10200, the blade that i drawn from thi sheath shall not be stained or broken even in defeat  she said ,LOTR1,False
10201, but i there aught else that you desire of me at our parting ,LOTR1,False
10202, for darkn will flow between u and it may be that we shall not meet again unl it be far hence upon a road that ha no returning ,LOTR1,False
10203, and aragorn answered: lady you know all my desire and long held in keeping the only treasure that i seek ,LOTR1,False
10204, yet it i not your to give me even if you would; and only through darkn shall i come to it ,LOTR1,False
10205, yet maybe thi will lighten your heart  said galadriel; for it wa left in my care to be given to you should you pas through thi land ,LOTR1,False
10206, then she lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green set in a silver brooch that wa wrought in the liken of an eagle with outspread wings; and a she held it up the gem flashed like the sun shining through the leave of spring ,LOTR1,False
10207, thi stone i gave to celebrnan my daughter and she to hers; and now it come to you a a token of hope ,LOTR1,False
10208, in thi hour take the name that wa foretold for you elessar the elfstone of the house of elendil ,LOTR1,False
10209,  then aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon hi breast and those who saw him wondered; for they had not marked before how tall and kingly he stood and it seemed to them that many year of toil had fallen from hi shoulder ,LOTR1,False
10210, for the gift that you have given me i thank you  he said o lady of lurien of whom were sprung celebrnan and arwen evenstar ,LOTR1,False
10211, what praise could i say more ,LOTR1,False
10212,  the lady bowed her head and she turned then to boromir and to him she gave a belt of gold; and to merry and pippin she gave small silver belt each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower ,LOTR1,False
10213, to legola she gave a bow such a the galadhrim used longer and stouter than the bow of mirkwood and strung with a string of elf hair ,LOTR1,False
10214, with it went a quiver of arrow ,LOTR1,False
10215, for you little gardener and lover of tree  she said to sam i have only a small gift ,LOTR1,False
10216, she put into hi hand a little box of plain grey wood unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid ,LOTR1,False
10217, here i set g for galadriel  she said; but also it may stand for garden in your tongue ,LOTR1,False
10218, in thi box there i earth from my orchard and such blessing a galadriel ha still to bestow i upon it ,LOTR1,False
10219, it will not keep you on your road nor defend you against any peril; but if you keep it and see your home again at last then perhap it may reward you ,LOTR1,False
10220, though you should find all barren and laid waste there will be few garden in middle earth that will bloom like your garden if you sprinkle thi earth there ,LOTR1,False
10221, then you may remember galadriel and catch a glimpse far off of lurien that you have seen only in our winter ,LOTR1,False
10222, for our spring and our summer are gone by and they will never be seen on earth again save in memory ,LOTR1,False
10223, sam went red to the ear and muttered something inaudible a he clutched the box and bowed a well a he could ,LOTR1,False
10224, and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves ,LOTR1,False
10225,  said galadriel turning to gimli ,LOTR1,False
10226, none lady  answered gimli ,LOTR1,False
10227, it i enough for me to have seen the lady of the galadhrim and to have heard her gentle word ,LOTR1,False
10228,  she cried to those about her ,LOTR1,False
10229, let none say again that dwarve are grasping and ungracious ,LOTR1,False
10230, yet surely gimli son of gluin you desire something that i could give ,LOTR1,False
10231, name it i bid you ,LOTR1,False
10232, you shall not be the only guest without a gift ,LOTR1,False
10233, there i nothing lady galadriel  said gimli bowing low and stammering ,LOTR1,False
10234, nothing unl it might be unl it i permitted to ask ,LOTR1,False
10235, nay to name a single strand of your hair which surpasse the gold of the earth a the star surpas the gem of the mine ,LOTR1,False
10236, i do not ask for such a gift ,LOTR1,False
10237, but you commanded me to name my desire ,LOTR1,False
10238, the elve stirred and murmured with astonishment and celeborn gazed at the dwarf in wonder but the lady smiled ,LOTR1,False
10239, it i said that the skill of the dwarve i in their hand rather than in their tongue  she said; yet that i not true of gimli ,LOTR1,False
10240, for none have ever made to me a request so bold and yet so courteou ,LOTR1,False
10241, and how shall i refuse since i commanded him to speak ,LOTR1,False
10242, but tell me what would you do with such a gift ,LOTR1,False
10243,  treasure it lady  he answered in memory of your word to me at our first meeting ,LOTR1,False
10244, and if ever i return to the smithie of my home it shall be set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house and a pledge of good will between the mountain and the wood until the end of day ,LOTR1,False
10245, then the lady unbraided one of her long tresse and cut off three golden hair and laid them in gimli hand ,LOTR1,False
10246, these word shall go with the gift  she said ,LOTR1,False
10247, i do not foretell for all foretelling i now vain: on the one hand lie darkn and on the other only hope ,LOTR1,False
10248, but if hope should not fail then i say to you gimli son of gluin that your hand shall flow with gold and yet over you gold shall have no dominion ,LOTR1,False
10249, and you ring bearer  she said turning to frodo ,LOTR1,False
10250, i come to you last who are not last in my thought ,LOTR1,False
10251, for you i have prepared thi ,LOTR1,False
10252, she held up a small crystal phial: it glittered a she moved it and ray of white light sprang from her hand ,LOTR1,False
10253, in thi phial  she said i caught the light of edrendil star set amid the water of my fountain ,LOTR1,False
10254, it will shine still brighter when night i about you ,LOTR1,False
10255, may it be a light to you in dark place when all other light go out ,LOTR1,False
10256, remember galadriel and her mirror ,LOTR1,False
10257,  frodo took the phial and for a moment a it shone between them he saw her again standing like a queen great and beautiful but no longer terrible ,LOTR1,False
10258, he bowed but found no word to say ,LOTR1,False
10259, now the lady arose and celeborn led them back to the hythe ,LOTR1,False
10260, a yellow noon lay on the green land of the tongue and the water glittered with silver ,LOTR1,False
10261, all at last wa made ready ,LOTR1,False
10262, the company took their place in the boat a before ,LOTR1,False
10263, crying farewell the elve of lurien with long grey pole thrust them out into the flowing stream and the rippling water bore them slowly away ,LOTR1,False
10264, the traveller sat still without moving or speaking ,LOTR1,False
10265, on the green bank near to the very point of the tongue the lady galadriel stood alone and silent ,LOTR1,False
10266, a they passed her they turned and their eye watched her slowly floating away from them ,LOTR1,False
10267, for so it seemed to them: lurien wa slipping backward like a bright ship masted with enchanted tree sailing on to forgotten shore while they sat helpl upon the margin of the grey and leafl world ,LOTR1,False
10268, even a they gazed the silverlode passed out into the current of the great river and their boat turned and began to speed southward ,LOTR1,False
10269, soon the white form of the lady wa small and distant ,LOTR1,False
10270, she shone like a window of glas upon a far hill in the westering sun or a a remote lake seen from a mountain: a crystal fallen in the lap of the land ,LOTR1,False
10271, then it seemed to frodo that she lifted her arm in a final farewell and far but piercing clear on the following wind came the sound of her voice singing ,LOTR1,False
10272, but now she sang in the ancient tongue of the elve beyond the sea and he did not understand the words: fair wa the music but it did not comfort him ,LOTR1,False
10273, yet a i the way of elvish word they remained graven in hi memory and long afterward he interpreted them a well a he could: the language wa that of elven song and spoke of thing little known on middle earth ,LOTR1,False
10274, lauril lantar lassi srinen yjni nutiml ve rbmar aldaron ,LOTR1,False
10275, yjni ve lintl yuldar avbnier mi oromardi lisse miruvureva andnl pella vardo tellumar nu luini yassen tintilar i eleni umaryo airetbri lnrinen ,LOTR1,False

10278, si vanwa nb rumello vanwa valimar ,LOTR1,False
10279, like gold fall the leave in the wind long year numberl a the wing of tree  ,LOTR1,False
10280, the long year have passed like swift draught of the sweet mead in lofty hall beyond the west beneath the blue vault of varda wherein the star tremble in the song of her voice holy and queenly ,LOTR1,False
10281, who now shall refill the cup for me ,LOTR1,False
10282, for now the kindler varda the queen of the star from mount everwhite ha uplifted her hand like cloud and all path are drowned deep in shadow; and out of a grey country darkn lie on the foaming wave between u and mist cover the jewel of calacirya for ever ,LOTR1,False
10283, now lost lost to those from the east i valimar ,LOTR1,False
10284, maybe thou shalt find valimar ,LOTR1,False
10285, maybe even thou shalt find it ,LOTR1,False
10286,  varda i the name of that fady whom the elve in these land of exile name elbereth ,LOTR1,False
10287, suddenly the river swept round a bend and the bank rose upon either side and the light of furien wa hidden ,LOTR1,False
10288, to that fair land frodo never came again ,LOTR1,False
10289, the traveller now turned their face to the journey; the sun wa before them and their eye were dazzled for all were filled with tear ,LOTR1,False
10290, i have looked the last upon that which wa fairest  he said to fegola hi companion ,LOTR1,False
10291, henceforward i will call nothing fair unl it be her gift ,LOTR1,False
10292, he put hi hand to hi breast ,LOTR1,False
10293, tell me fegola why did i come on thi quest ,LOTR1,False
10294, tittle did i know where the chief peril lay ,LOTR1,False
10295, truly elrond spoke saying that we could not foresee what we might meet upon our road ,LOTR1,False
10296, torment in the dark wa the danger that i feared and it did not hold me back ,LOTR1,False
10297, but i would not have come had i known the danger of light and joy ,LOTR1,False
10298, now i have taken my worst wound in thi parting even if i were to go thi night straight to the dark ford ,LOTR1,False
10299, ala for gimli son of gluin ,LOTR1,False
10300, and for all that walk the world in these after day ,LOTR1,False
10301, for such i the way of it: to find and lose a it seem to those whose boat i on the running stream ,LOTR1,False
10302, but i count you blessed gimli son of gluin: for your los you suffer of your own free will and you might have chosen otherwise ,LOTR1,False
10303, but you have not forsaken your companion and the least reward that you shall have i that the memory of fothlurien shall remain ever clear and unstained in your heart and shall neither fade nor grow stale ,LOTR1,False
10304, maybe  said gimli; and i thank you for your word ,LOTR1,False
10305, true word doubtless; yet all such comfort i cold ,LOTR1,False
10306, memory i not what the heart desire ,LOTR1,False
10307, that i only a mirror be it clear a kheled zvram ,LOTR1,False
10308, or so say the heart of gimli the dwarf ,LOTR1,False
10309, elve may see thing otherwise ,LOTR1,False
10310, indeed i have heard that for them memory i more like to the waking world than to a dream ,LOTR1,False
10311, but let u talk no more of it ,LOTR1,False
10312, she i too low in the water with all thi baggage and the great river i swift ,LOTR1,False
10313, i do not wish to drown my grief in cold water ,LOTR1,False
10314, he took up a paddle and steered toward the western bank following aragorn boat ahead which had already moved out of the middle stream ,LOTR1,False
10315, so the company went on their long way down the wide hurrying water borne ever southward ,LOTR1,False
10316, bare wood stalked along either bank and they could not see any glimpse of the land behind ,LOTR1,False
10317, the breeze died away and the river flowed without a sound ,LOTR1,False
10318, no voice of bird broke the silence ,LOTR1,False
10319, the sun grew misty a the day grew old until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl ,LOTR1,False
10320, then it faded into the west and dusk came early followed by a grey and starl night ,LOTR1,False
10321, far into the dark quiet hour they floated on guiding their boat under the overhanging shadow of the western wood ,LOTR1,False
10322, great tree passed by like ghost thrusting their twisted thirsty root through the mist down into the water ,LOTR1,False
10323, it wa dreary and cold ,LOTR1,False
10324, frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle of the river fretting among the tree root and driftwood near the shore until hi head nodded and he fell into an uneasy sleep ,LOTR1,False
10325, the great river frodo wa roused by sam ,LOTR1,False
10326, he found that he wa lying well wrapped under tall grey skinned tree in a quiet corner of the woodland on the west bank of the great river anduin ,LOTR1,False
10327, he had slept the night away and the grey of morning wa dim among the bare branche ,LOTR1,False
10328, gimli wa busy with a small fire near at hand ,LOTR1,False
10329, they started again before the day wa broad ,LOTR1,False
10330, not that most of the company were eager to hurry southwards: they were content that the decision which they must make at latest when they came to rauro and the tindrock isle still lay some day ahead; and they let the river bear them on at it own pace having no desire to hasten toward the peril that lay beyond whichever course they took in the end ,LOTR1,False
10331, aragorn let them drift with the stream a they wished husbanding their strength against wearin to come ,LOTR1,False
10332, but he insisted that at least they should start early each day and journey on far into the evening; for he felt in hi heart that time wa pressing and he feared that the dark lord had not been idle while they lingered in lurien ,LOTR1,False
10333, nonethel they saw no sign of an enemy that day nor the next ,LOTR1,False
10334, the dull grey hour passed without event ,LOTR1,False
10335, a the third day of their voyage wore on the land changed slowly: the tree thinned and then failed altogether ,LOTR1,False
10336, on the eastern bank to their left they saw long forml slope stretching up and away toward the sky; brown and withered they looked a if fire had passed over them leaving no living blade of green: an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptin ,LOTR1,False
10337, they had come to the brown land that lay vast and desolate between southern mirkwood and the hill of the emyn muil ,LOTR1,False
10338, what pestilence or war or evil deed of the enemy had so blasted all that region even aragorn could not tell ,LOTR1,False
10339, upon the west to their right the land wa treel also but it wa flat and in many place green with wide plain of gras ,LOTR1,False
10340, on thi side of the river they passed forest of great reed so tall that they shut out all view to the west a the little boat went rustling by along their fluttering border ,LOTR1,False
10341, their dark withered plume bent and tossed in the light cold air hissing softly and sadly ,LOTR1,False
10342, here and there through opening frodo could catch sudden glimpse of rolling mead and far beyond them hill in the sunset and away on the edge of sight a dark line where marched the southernmost rank of the misty mountain ,LOTR1,False
10343, there wa no sign of living moving thing save bird ,LOTR1,False
10344, of these there were many: small fowl whistling and piping in the reed but they were seldom seen ,LOTR1,False
10345, once or twice the traveller heard the rush and whine of swan wing and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky ,LOTR1,False
10346, and mighty big one too ,LOTR1,False
10347,  ye  said aragorn and they are black swan ,LOTR1,False
10348, how wide and empty and mournful all thi country looks ,LOTR1,False
10349, i alway imagined that a one journeyed south it got warmer and merrier until winter wa left behind for ever ,LOTR1,False
10350, but we have not journeyed far south yet  answered aragorn ,LOTR1,False
10351, it i still winter and we are far from the sea ,LOTR1,False
10352, here the world i cold until the sudden spring and we may yet have snow again ,LOTR1,False
10353, far away down in the bay of belfala to which anduin run it i warm and merry maybe or would be but for the enemy ,LOTR1,False
10354, but here we are not above sixty league i gu south of the southfarthing away in your shire hundred of long mile yonder ,LOTR1,False
10355, you are looking now south west acros the north plain of the riddermark rohan the land of the horse lord ,LOTR1,False
10356, ere long we shall come to the mouth of the limlight that run down from fangorn to join the great river ,LOTR1,False
10357, that i the north boundary of rohan; and of old all that lay between limlight and the white mountain belonged to the rohirrim ,LOTR1,False
10358, it i a rich and pleasant land and it gras ha no rival; but in these evil day folk do not dwell by the river or ride often to it shore ,LOTR1,False
10359, anduin i wide yet the ore can shoot their arrow far acros the stream; and of late it i said they have dared to cros the water and raid the herd and stud of rohan ,LOTR1,False
10360, sam looked from bank to bank uneasily ,LOTR1,False
10361, the tree had seemed hostile before a if they harboured secret eye and lurking dangers; now he wished that the tree were still there ,LOTR1,False
10362, he felt that the company wa too naked afloat in little open boat in the midst of shelterl land and on a river that wa the frontier of war ,LOTR1,False
10363, in the next day or two a they went on borne steadily southward thi feeling of insecurity grew on all the company ,LOTR1,False
10364, for a whole day they took to their paddle and hastened forward ,LOTR1,False
10365, soon the river broadened and grew more shallow; long stony beache lay upon the east and there were gravel shoal in the water so that careful steering wa needed ,LOTR1,False
10366, the brown land rose into bleak wold over which flowed a chill air from the east ,LOTR1,False
10367, on the other side the mead had become rolling down of withered gras amidst a land of fen and tussock ,LOTR1,False
10368, frodo shivered thinking of the lawn and fountain the clear sun and gentle rain of lothlurien ,LOTR1,False
10369, there wa little speech and no laughter in any of the boat ,LOTR1,False
10370, each member of the company wa busy with hi own thought ,LOTR1,False
10371, the heart of legola wa running under the star of a summer night in some northern glade amid the beech woods; gimli wa fingering gold in hi mind and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the lady gift ,LOTR1,False
10372, merry and pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease for boromir sat muttering to himself sometime biting hi nail a if some restlessn or doubt consumed him sometime seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind aragorn ,LOTR1,False
10373, then pippin who sat in the bow looking back caught a queer gleam in hi eye a he peered forward gazing at frodo ,LOTR1,False
10374, sam had long ago made up hi mind that though boat were maybe not a dangerou a he had been brought up to believe they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined ,LOTR1,False
10375, fie wa cramped and miserable having nothing to do but stare at the winter land crawling by and the grey water on either side of him ,LOTR1,False
10376, even when the paddle were in use they did not trust sam with one ,LOTR1,False
10377, a dusk drew down on the fourth day he wa looking back over the bowed head of frodo and aragorn and the following boats; he wa drowsy and longed for camp and the feel of earth under hi toe ,LOTR1,False
10378, suddenly something caught hi sight: at first he stared at it listlessly then he sat up and rubbed hi eyes; but when he looked again he could not see it any more ,LOTR1,False
10379, that night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank ,LOTR1,False
10380, sam lay rolled in blanket beside frodo ,LOTR1,False
10381, v i had a funny dream an hour or two before we stopped mr frodo  he said ,LOTR1,False
10382, or maybe it wasnt a dream ,LOTR1,False
10383,  said frodo knowing that sam would not settle down until he had told hi tale whatever it wa ,LOTR1,False
10384, i havent seen or thought of anything to make me smile since we left lothlurien ,LOTR1,False
10385, it wasnt funny that way mr frodo ,LOTR1,False
10386, all wrong if it wasnt a dream ,LOTR1,False
10387, and you had best hear it ,LOTR1,False
10388, it wa like this: i saw a log with eyes ,LOTR1,False
10389,  the log all right  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
10390, there are many in the river ,LOTR1,False
10391, but leave out the eye  ,LOTR1,False
10392,  that i wont  said sam ,LOTR1,False
10393,  twa the eye a made me sit up so to speak ,LOTR1,False
10394, i saw what i took to be a log floating along in the half light behind gimli boat; but i didnt give much heed to it ,LOTR1,False
10395, then it seemed a if the log wa slowly catching u up ,LOTR1,False
10396, and that wa peculiar a you might say seeing a we were all floating on the stream together ,LOTR1,False
10397, just then i saw the eyes: two pale sort of point shiny like on a hump at the near end of the log ,LOTR1,False
10398, what more it wasnt a log for it had paddle feet like a swan almost only they seemed bigger and kept dipping in and out of the water ,LOTR1,False
10399, that when i sat right up and rubbed my eye meaning to give a shout if it wa still there when i had rubbed the drowse out of my head ,LOTR1,False
10400, for the whatever it wa wa coming along fast now and getting close behind gimli ,LOTR1,False
10401, but whether those two lamp spotted me moving and staring or whether i came to my sense i dont know ,LOTR1,False
10402, when i looked again it wasnt there ,LOTR1,False
10403, yet i think i caught a glimpse with the tail of my eye a the saying i of something dark shooting under the shadow of the bank ,LOTR1,False
10404, i couldnt see no more eye though ,LOTR1,False
10405, i said to myself: dreaming again sam gamgee i said: and i said no more just then ,LOTR1,False
10406, but ive been thinking since and now im not so sure ,LOTR1,False
10407, what do you make of it mr frodo ,LOTR1,False
10408,  i should make nothing of it but a log and the dusk and sleep in your eye sam said frodo if thi wa the first time that those eye had been seen ,LOTR1,False
10409, i saw them away back north before we reached lurien ,LOTR1,False
10410, and i saw a strange creature with eye climbing to the flet that night ,LOTR1,False
10411, and do you remember the report of the elve that went after the ore band ,LOTR1,False
10412,  ah  said sam ,LOTR1,False
10413, i do; and i remember more too ,LOTR1,False
10414, i dont like my thoughts; but thinking of one thing and another and mr bilbo storie and all i fancy i could put a name on the creature at a gu ,LOTR1,False
10415,  ye that i what i have feared for some time  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
10416, ever since the night on the flet ,LOTR1,False
10417, i suppose he wa lurking in moria and picked up our trail then; but i hoped that our stay in lurien would throw him off the scent again ,LOTR1,False
10418, the miserable creature must have been hiding in the wood by the silverlode watching u start off ,LOTR1,False
10419,  that about it  said sam ,LOTR1,False
10420, and wed better be a bit more watchful ourselve or well feel some nasty finger round our neck one of these night if we ever wake up to feel anything ,LOTR1,False
10421, and that what i wa leading up to ,LOTR1,False
10422, no need to trouble strider or the other tonight ,LOTR1,False
10423, i can sleep tomorrow being no more than luggage in a boat a you might say ,LOTR1,False
10424, v i might  said frodo and i might say luggage with eyes ,LOTR1,False
10425, you shall watch; but only if you promise to wake me halfway toward morning if nothing happen before then ,LOTR1,False
10426, in the dead hour frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find sam shaking him ,LOTR1,False
10427, it a shame to wake you  whispered sam but that what you said ,LOTR1,False
10428, there nothing to tell or not much ,LOTR1,False
10429, i thought i heard some soft plashing and a sniffing noise a while back; but you hear a lot of such queer sound by a river at night ,LOTR1,False
10430, he lay down and frodo sat up huddled in hi blanket and fought off hi sleep ,LOTR1,False
10431, minute or hour passed slowly and nothing happened ,LOTR1,False
10432, frodo wa just yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape hardly visible floated close to one of the moored boat ,LOTR1,False
10433, a long whitish hand could be dimly seen a it shot out and grabbed the gunwale; two pale lamplike eye shone coldly a they peered inside and then they lifted and gazed up at frodo on the eyot ,LOTR1,False
10434, they were not more than a yard or two away and frodo heard the soft his of intaken breath ,LOTR1,False
10435, he stood up drawing sting from it sheath and faced the eye ,LOTR1,False
10436, immediately their light wa shut off ,LOTR1,False
10437, there wa another his and a splash and the dark log shape shot away downstream into the night ,LOTR1,False
10438, aragorn stirred in hi sleep turned over and sat up what i it ,LOTR1,False
10439,  he whispered springing up and coming to frodo ,LOTR1,False
10440, i felt something in my sleep ,LOTR1,False
10441, why have you drawn your sword ,LOTR1,False
10442,  gollum  answered frodo ,LOTR1,False
10443, or at least so i gu ,LOTR1,False
10444, so you know about our little footpad do you ,LOTR1,False
10445, he padded after u all through moria and right down to nimrodel ,LOTR1,False
10446, since we took to boat he ha been lying on a log and paddling with hand and feet ,LOTR1,False
10447, i have tried to catch him once or twice at night; but he i slier than a fox and a slippery a a fish ,LOTR1,False
10448, i hoped the river voyage would beat him but he i too clever a waterman ,LOTR1,False
10449, we shall have to try going faster tomorrow ,LOTR1,False
10450, you lie down now and i will keep watch for what i left of the night ,LOTR1,False
10451, i wish i could lay my hand on the wretch ,LOTR1,False
10452, we might make him useful ,LOTR1,False
10453, but if i cannot we shall have to try and lose him ,LOTR1,False
10454, quite apart from murder by night on hi own account he may put any enemy that i about on our track ,LOTR1,False
10455, the night passed without gollum showing so much a a shadow again ,LOTR1,False
10456, after that the company kept a sharp look out but they saw no more of gollum while the voyage lasted ,LOTR1,False
10457, if he wa still following he wa very wary and cunning ,LOTR1,False
10458, at aragorn bidding they paddled now for long spell and the bank went swiftly by ,LOTR1,False
10459, but they saw little of the country for they journeyed mostly by night and twilight resting by day and lying a hidden a the land allowed ,LOTR1,False
10460, in thi way the time passed without event until the seventh day ,LOTR1,False
10461, the weather wa still grey and overcast with wind from the east but a evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared and pool of faint light yellow and pale green opened under the grey shore of cloud ,LOTR1,False
10462, there the white rind of the new moon could be seen glimmering in the remote lake ,LOTR1,False
10463, sam looked at it and puckered hi brow ,LOTR1,False
10464, the next day the country on either side began to change rapidly ,LOTR1,False
10465, the bank began to rise and grow stony ,LOTR1,False
10466, soon they were passing through a hilly rocky land and on both shore there were steep slope buried in deep brake of thorn and sloe tangled with bramble and creeper ,LOTR1,False
10467, behind them stood low crumbling cliff and chimney of grey weathered stone dark with ivy; and beyond these again there rose high ridge crowned with wind writhen fir ,LOTR1,False
10468, they were drawing near to the grey hill country of the emyn muil the southern march of wilderland ,LOTR1,False
10469, there were many bird about the cliff and the rock chimney and all day high in the air flock of bird had been circling black against the pale sky ,LOTR1,False
10470, a they lay in their camp that day aragorn watched the flight doubtfully wondering if gollum had been doing some mischief and the new of their voyage wa now moving in the wildern ,LOTR1,False
10471, later a the sun wa setting and the company wa stirring and getting ready to start again he descried a dark spot against the fading light: a great bird high and far off now wheeling now flying on slowly southward ,LOTR1,False
10472,  he asked pointing to the northern sky ,LOTR1,False
10473, i it a i think an eagle ,LOTR1,False
10474, it i an eagle a hunting eagle ,LOTR1,False
10475, i wonder what that forebode ,LOTR1,False
10476, it i far from the mountain ,LOTR1,False
10477, we will not start until it i fully dark  said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
10478, the eighth night of their journey came ,LOTR1,False
10479, it wa silent and windless; the grey east wind had passed away ,LOTR1,False
10480, the thin crescent of the moon had fallen early into the pale sunset but the sky wa clear above and though far away in the south there were great range of cloud that still shone faintly in the west star glinted bright ,LOTR1,False
10481, we will venture one more journey by night ,LOTR1,False
10482, we are coming to reache of the river that i do not know well: for i have never journeyed by water in these part before not between here and the rapid of sarn gebir ,LOTR1,False
10483, but if i am right in my reckoning those are still many mile ahead ,LOTR1,False
10484, still there are dangerou place even before we come there: rock and stony eyot in the stream ,LOTR1,False
10485, we must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly ,LOTR1,False
10486, to sam in the leading boat wa given the task of watchman ,LOTR1,False
10487, he lay forward peering into the gloom ,LOTR1,False
10488, the night grew dark but the star above were strangely bright and there wa a glimmer on the face of the river ,LOTR1,False
10489, it wa close on midnight and they had been drifting for some while hardly using the paddle when suddenly sam cried out ,LOTR1,False
10490, only a few yard ahead dark shape loomed up in the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water ,LOTR1,False
10491, there wa a swift current which swung left toward the eastern shore where the channel wa clear ,LOTR1,False
10492, a they were swept aside the traveller could see now very close the pale foam of the river lashing against sharp rock that were thrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth ,LOTR1,False
10493, the boat were all huddled together ,LOTR1,False
10494,  shouted boromir a hi boat bumped into the leader ,LOTR1,False
10495, we cannot dare the rapid by night ,LOTR1,False
10496, but no boat can live in sarn gebir be it night or day ,LOTR1,False
10497,  he drove hi paddle into the water trying to hold the boat and bring it round ,LOTR1,False
10498, i am out of my reckoning  he said to frodo ,LOTR1,False
10499, i did not know that we had come so far: anduin flow faster than i thought ,LOTR1,False
10500, sarn gebir must be close at hand already ,LOTR1,False
10501, with great effort they checked the boat and slowly brought them about; but at first they could make only small headway against the current and all the time they were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank ,LOTR1,False
10502, now dark and ominou it loomed up in the night ,LOTR1,False
10503, or we shall be driven on the shoal ,LOTR1,False
10504, even a he spoke frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone ,LOTR1,False
10505, at that moment there wa a twang of bowstrings: several arrow whistled over them and some fell among them ,LOTR1,False
10506, one smote frodo between the shoulder and he lurched forward with a cry letting go hi paddle: but the arrow fell back foiled by hi hidden coat of mail ,LOTR1,False
10507, another passed through aragorn hood; and a third stood fast in the gunwale of the second boat close by merry hand ,LOTR1,False
10508, sam thought he could glimpse black figure running to and fro upon the long shingle bank that lay under the eastern shore ,LOTR1,False
10509, said legola falling into hi own tongue ,LOTR1,False
10510, gollum doing ill be bound ,LOTR1,False
10511, and a nice place to choose too ,LOTR1,False
10512, the river seem set on taking u right into their arms ,LOTR1,False
10513,  they all leaned forward straining at the paddles: even sam took a hand ,LOTR1,False
10514, every moment they expected to feel the bite of black feathered arrow ,LOTR1,False
10515, many whined overhead or struck the water nearby; but there were no more hit ,LOTR1,False
10516, it wa dark but not too dark for the night eye of ore and in the star glimmer they must have offered their cunning foe some mark unl it wa that the grey cloak of lurien and the grey timber of the elf wrought boat defeated the malice of the archer of mordor ,LOTR1,False
10517, stroke by stroke they laboured on ,LOTR1,False
10518, in the darkn it wa hard to be sure that they were indeed moving at all; but slowly the swirl of the water grew l and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the night ,LOTR1,False
10519, at last a far a they could judge they had reached the middle of the stream again and had driven their boat back some distance above the jutting rock ,LOTR1,False
10520, then half turning they thrust them with all their strength toward the western shore ,LOTR1,False
10521, under the shadow of bushe leaning out over the water they halted and drew breath ,LOTR1,False
10522, legola laid down hi paddle and took up the bow that he had brought from lurien ,LOTR1,False
10523, then he sprang ashore and climbed a few pace up the bank ,LOTR1,False
10524, stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned peering back over the river into the darkn ,LOTR1,False
10525, acros the water there were shrill crie but nothing could be seen ,LOTR1,False
10526, frodo looked up at the elf standing tall above him a he gazed into the night seeking a mark to shoot at ,LOTR1,False
10527, hi head wa dark crowned with sharp white star that glittered in the black pool of the sky behind ,LOTR1,False
10528, but now rising and sailing up from the south the great cloud advanced sending out dark outrider into the starry field ,LOTR1,False
10529, a sudden dread fell on the company ,LOTR1,False
10530, sighed legola a he looked up ,LOTR1,False
10531, even a he did so a dark shape like a cloud and yet not a cloud for it moved far more swiftly came out of the blackn in the south and sped toward the company blotting out all light a it approached ,LOTR1,False
10532, soon it appeared a a great winged creature blacker than the pit in the night ,LOTR1,False
10533, fierce voice rose up to greet it from acros the water ,LOTR1,False
10534, frodo felt a sudden chill running through him and clutching at hi heart; there wa a deadly cold like the memory of an old wound in hi shoulder ,LOTR1,False
10535, he crouched down a if to hide ,LOTR1,False
10536, suddenly the great bow of lurien sang ,LOTR1,False
10537, shrill went the arrow from the elven string ,LOTR1,False
10538, almost above him the winged shape swerved ,LOTR1,False
10539, there wa a harsh croaking scream a it fell out of the air vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shore ,LOTR1,False
10540, the sky wa clean again ,LOTR1,False
10541, there wa a tumult of many voice far away cursing and wailing in the darkn and then silence ,LOTR1,False
10542, neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night ,LOTR1,False
10543, after a while aragorn led the boat back upstream ,LOTR1,False
10544, they felt their way along the water edge for some distance until they found a small shallow bay ,LOTR1,False
10545, a few low tree grew there close to the water and behind them rose a steep rocky bank ,LOTR1,False
10546, here the company decided to stay and await the dawn: it wa usel to attempt to move further by night ,LOTR1,False
10547, they made no camp and lit no fire but lay huddled in the boat moored close together ,LOTR1,False
10548, praised be the bow of galadriel and the hand and eye of legola  ,LOTR1,False
10549,  said gimli a he munched a wafer of lemba ,LOTR1,False
10550, that wa a mighty shot in the dark my friend ,LOTR1,False
10551, but who can say what it hit ,LOTR1,False
10552, i cannot  said gimli ,LOTR1,False
10553, but i am glad that the shadow came no nearer ,LOTR1,False
10554, i liked it not at all ,LOTR1,False
10555, too much it reminded me of the shadow in moria the shadow of the balrog  he ended in a whisper ,LOTR1,False
10556, it wa not a balrog  said frodo still shivering with the chill that had come upon him ,LOTR1,False
10557, i think it wa  then he paused and fell silent ,LOTR1,False
10558,  asked boromir eagerly leaning from hi boat a if he wa trying to catch a glimpse of frodo face ,LOTR1,False
10559, i think no i will not say  answered frodo ,LOTR1,False
10560, whatever it wa it fall ha dismayed our enemie ,LOTR1,False
10561, so it seem  said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
10562, yet where they are and how many and what they will do next we do not know ,LOTR1,False
10563, thi night we must all be sleepless ,LOTR1,False
10564, but what the day will show who can tell ,LOTR1,False
10565, have your weapon close to hand ,LOTR1,False
10566,  sam sat tapping the hilt of hi sword a if he were counting on hi finger and looking up at the sky ,LOTR1,False
10567, it very strange  he murmured ,LOTR1,False
10568, the moon the same in the shire and in wilderland or it ought to be ,LOTR1,False
10569, but either it out of it running or im all wrong in my reckoning ,LOTR1,False
10570, youll remember mr frodo the moon wa waning a we lay on the flet up in that tree: a week from the full i reckon ,LOTR1,False
10571, and wed been a week on the way last night when up pop a new moon a thin a a nail paring a if we had never stayed no time in the elvish country ,LOTR1,False
10572, well i can remember three night there for certain and i seem to remember several more but i would take my oath it wa never a whole month ,LOTR1,False
10573, anyone would think that time did not count in there ,LOTR1,False
10574,  and perhap that wa the way of it  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
10575, in that land maybe we were in a time that ha elsewhere long gone by ,LOTR1,False
10576, it wa not i think until silverlode bore u back to anduin that we returned to the time that flow through mortal land to the great sea ,LOTR1,False
10577, and i dont remember any moon either new or old in cara galadhon: only star by night and sun by day ,LOTR1,False
10578, legola stirred in hi boat ,LOTR1,False
10579, nay time doe not tarry ever  he said; but change and growth i not in all thing and place alike ,LOTR1,False
10580, for the elve the world move and it move both very swift and very slow ,LOTR1,False
10581, swift because they themselve change little and all else fleet by: it i a grief to them ,LOTR1,False
10582, slow because they do not count the running year not for themselve ,LOTR1,False
10583, the passing season are but ripple ever repeated in the long long stream ,LOTR1,False
10584, yet beneath the sun all thing must wear to an end at last ,LOTR1,False
10585, but the wearing i slow in lurien  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
10586, the power of the lady i on it ,LOTR1,False
10587, rich are the hour though short they seem in cara galadhon where galadriel wield the elven ring ,LOTR1,False
10588, that should not have been said outside lurien not even to me  said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
10589, speak no more of it ,LOTR1,False
10590, but so it i sam: in that land you lost your count ,LOTR1,False
10591, there time flowed swiftly by u a for the elve ,LOTR1,False
10592, the old moon passed and a new moon waxed and waned in the world outside while we tarried there ,LOTR1,False
10593, and yestereve a new moon came again ,LOTR1,False
10594, time flow on to a spring of little hope ,LOTR1,False
10595, no voice or call wa heard again acros the water ,LOTR1,False
10596, the traveller huddled in their boat felt the changing of the weather ,LOTR1,False
10597, the air grew warm and very still under the great moist cloud that had floated up from the south and the distant sea ,LOTR1,False
10598, the rushing of the river over the rock of the rapid seemed to grow louder and closer ,LOTR1,False
10599, the twig of the tree above them began to drip ,LOTR1,False
10600, when the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and sad ,LOTR1,False
10601, slowly the dawn grew to a pale light diffused and shadowl ,LOTR1,False
10602, there wa mist on the river and white fog swathed the shore; the far bank could not be seen ,LOTR1,False
10603, i cant abide fog  said sam; but thi seem to be a lucky one ,LOTR1,False
10604, now perhap we can get away without those cursed goblin seeing u ,LOTR1,False
10605, perhap so  said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
10606, but it will be hard to find the path unl the fog lift a little later on ,LOTR1,False
10607, and we must find the path if we are to pas sarn gebir and come to the emyn muil ,LOTR1,False
10608, i do not see why we should pas the rapid or follow the river any further  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
10609, if the emyn muil lie before u then we can abandon these cockle boat and strike westward and southward until we come to the entwash and cros into my own land ,LOTR1,False
10610, we can if we are making for mina tirith  said aragorn but that i not yet agreed ,LOTR1,False
10611, and such a course may be more perilou than it sound ,LOTR1,False
10612, the vale of entwash i flat and fenny and fog i a deadly peril there for those on foot and laden ,LOTR1,False
10613, i would not abandon our boat until we must ,LOTR1,False
10614, the river i at least a path that cannot be missed ,LOTR1,False
10615, but the enemy hold the eastern bank  objected boromir ,LOTR1,False
10616, and even if you pas the gate of argonath and come unmolested to the tindrock what will you do then ,LOTR1,False
10617, leap down the fall and land in the marshes ,LOTR1,False
10618, say rather that we will bear our boat by the ancient way to rauros foot and there take to the water again ,LOTR1,False
10619, do you not know boromir or do you choose to forget the north stair and the high seat upon amon hen that were made in the day of the great kings ,LOTR1,False
10620, i at least have a mind to stand in that high place again before i decide my further course ,LOTR1,False
10621, there maybe we shall see some sign that will guide u ,LOTR1,False
10622, boromir held out long against thi choice; but when it became plain that frodo would follow aragorn wherever he went he gave in ,LOTR1,False
10623, it i not the way of the men of mina tirith to desert their friend at need  he said and you will need my strength if ever you are to reach the tindrock ,LOTR1,False
10624, to the tall isle i will go but no further ,LOTR1,False
10625, there i shall turn to my home alone if my help ha not earned the reward of any companionship ,LOTR1,False
10626, the day wa now growing and the fog had lifted a little ,LOTR1,False
10627, it wa decided that aragorn and legola should at once go forward along the shore while the other remained by the boat ,LOTR1,False
10628, aragorn hoped to find some way by which they could carry both their boat and their baggage to the smoother water beyond the rapid ,LOTR1,False
10629, boat of the elve would not sink maybe  he said but that doe not say that we should come through sarn gebir alive ,LOTR1,False
10630, none have ever done so yet ,LOTR1,False
10631, no road wa made by the men of gondor in thi region for even in their great day their realm did not reach up anduin beyond the emyn muil; but there i a portage way somewhere on the western shore if i can find it ,LOTR1,False
10632, it cannot yet have perished; for light boat used to journey out of wilderland down to osgiliath and still did so until a few year ago when the ore of mordor began to multiply ,LOTR1,False
10633, seldom in my life ha any boat come out of the north and the ore prowl on the east shore  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
10634, if you go forward peril will grow with every mile even if you find a path ,LOTR1,False
10635, peril lie ahead on every southward road  answered aragorn ,LOTR1,False
10636, wait for u one day ,LOTR1,False
10637, if we do not return in that time you will know that evil ha indeed befallen u ,LOTR1,False
10638, then you must take a new leader and follow him a best you can ,LOTR1,False
10639, it wa with a heavy heart that frodo saw aragorn and legola climb the steep bank and vanish into the mists; but hi fear proved groundl ,LOTR1,False
10640, only two or three hour had passed and it wa barely mid day when the shadowy shape of the explorer appeared again ,LOTR1,False
10641, all i well  said aragorn a he clambered down the bank ,LOTR1,False
10642, there i a track and it lead to a good landing that i still serviceable ,LOTR1,False
10643, the distance i not great: the head of the rapid i but half a mile below u and they are little more than a mile long ,LOTR1,False
10644, not far beyond them the stream become clear and smooth again though it run swiftly ,LOTR1,False
10645, our hardest task will be to get our boat and baggage to the old portage way ,LOTR1,False
10646, we have found it but it lie well back from the water side here and run under the lee of a rock wall a furlong or more from the shore ,LOTR1,False
10647, we did not find where the northward landing lie ,LOTR1,False
10648, if it still remain we must have passed it yesterday night ,LOTR1,False
10649, we might labour far upstream and yet mis it in the fog ,LOTR1,False
10650, i fear we must leave the river now and make for the portage way a best we can from here ,LOTR1,False
10651, that would not be easy even if we were all men  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
10652, yet such a we are we will try it  said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
10653, aye we will  said gimli ,LOTR1,False
10654, the leg of men will lag on a rough road while a dwarf goe on be the burden twice hi own weight master boromir ,LOTR1,False
10655,  the task proved hard indeed yet in the end it wa done ,LOTR1,False
10656, the good were taken out of the boat and brought to the top of the bank where there wa a level space ,LOTR1,False
10657, then the boat were drawn out of the water and carried up ,LOTR1,False
10658, they were far l heavy than any had expected ,LOTR1,False
10659, of what tree growing in the elvish country they were made not even legola knew; but the wood wa tough and yet strangely light ,LOTR1,False
10660, merry and pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat ,LOTR1,False
10661, nonethel it needed the strength of the two men to lift and haul them over the ground that the company now had to cros ,LOTR1,False
10662, it sloped up away from the river a tumbled waste of grey limestone boulder with many hidden hole shrouded with weed and bushes; there were thicket of bramble and sheer dells; and here and there boggy pool fed by water trickling from the terrace further inland ,LOTR1,False
10663, one by one boromir and aragorn carried the boat while the other toiled and scrambled after them with the baggage ,LOTR1,False
10664, at last all wa removed and laid on the portage way ,LOTR1,False
10665, then with little further hindrance save from sprawling briar and many fallen stone they moved forward all together ,LOTR1,False
10666, fog still hung in veil upon the crumbling rock wall and to their left mist shrouded the river: they could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelve and stony teeth of sarn gebir but they could not see it ,LOTR1,False
10667, twice they made the journey before all wa brought safe to the southern landing ,LOTR1,False
10668, there the portage way turning back to the water side ran gently down to the shallow edge of a little pool ,LOTR1,False
10669, it seemed to have been scooped in the river side not by hand but by the water swirling down from sarn gebir against a low pier of rock that jutted out some way into the stream ,LOTR1,False
10670, beyond it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff and there wa no further passage for those on foot ,LOTR1,False
10671, already the short afternoon wa past and a dim cloudy dusk wa closing in ,LOTR1,False
10672, they sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and roar of the rapid hidden in the mist; they were tired and sleepy and their heart were a gloomy a the dying day ,LOTR1,False
10673, well here we are and here we must pas another night  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
10674, we need sleep and even if aragorn had a mind to pas the gate of argonath by night we are all too tired except no doubt our sturdy dwarf ,LOTR1,False
10675, gimli made no reply: he wa nodding a he sat ,LOTR1,False
10676, let u rest a much a we can now  said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
10677, tomorrow we must journey by day again ,LOTR1,False
10678, unl the weather change once more and cheat u we shall have a good chance of slipping through unseen by any eye on the eastern shore ,LOTR1,False
10679, but tonight two must watch together in turns: three hour off and one on guard ,LOTR1,False
10680, nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour before dawn ,LOTR1,False
10681, a soon a it wa fully light they started ,LOTR1,False
10682, already the fog wa thinning ,LOTR1,False
10683, they kept a close a they could to the western side and they could see the dim shape of the low cliff rising ever higher shadowy wall with their feet in the hurrying river ,LOTR1,False
10684, in the mid morning the cloud drew down lower and it began to rain heavily ,LOTR1,False
10685, they drew the skin cover over their boat to prevent them from being flooded and drifted on: little could be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtain ,LOTR1,False
10686, the rain however did not last long ,LOTR1,False
10687, slowly the sky above grew lighter and then suddenly the cloud broke and their draggled fringe trailed away northward up the river ,LOTR1,False
10688, the fog and mist were gone ,LOTR1,False
10689, before the traveller lay a wide ravine with great rocky side to which clung upon shelve and in narrow crevice a few thrawn tree ,LOTR1,False
10690, the channel grew narrower and the river swifter ,LOTR1,False
10691, now they were speeding along with little hope of stopping or turning whatever they might meet ahead ,LOTR1,False
10692, over them wa a lane of pale blue sky around them the dark overshadowed river and before them black shutting out the sun the hill of emyn muil in which no opening could be seen ,LOTR1,False
10693, frodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rock approaching: like great pinnacle or pillar of stone they seemed ,LOTR1,False
10694, tall and sheer and ominou they stood upon either side of the stream ,LOTR1,False
10695, a narrow gap appeared between them and the river swept the boat toward it ,LOTR1,False
10696, behold the argonath the pillar of the kings ,LOTR1,False
10697, we shall pas them soon ,LOTR1,False
10698, keep the boat in line and a far apart a you can ,LOTR1,False
10699, hold the middle of the stream ,LOTR1,False
10700,  a frodo wa borne toward them the great pillar rose like tower to meet him ,LOTR1,False
10701, giant they seemed to him vast grey figure silent but threatening ,LOTR1,False
10702, then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned: the craft and power of old had wrought upon them and still they preserved through the sun and rain of forgotten year the mighty likenesse in which they had been hewn ,LOTR1,False
10703, upon great pedestal founded in the deep water stood two great king of stone: still with blurred eye and crannied brow they frowned upon the north ,LOTR1,False
10704, the left hand of each wa raised palm outward in gesture of warning; in each right hand there wa an axe; upon each head there wa a crumbling helm and crown ,LOTR1,False
10705, great power and majesty they still wore the silent warden of a long vanished kingdom ,LOTR1,False
10706, awe and fear fell upon frodo and he cowered down shutting hi eye and not daring to look up a the boat drew near ,LOTR1,False
10707, even boromir bowed hi head a the boat whirled by ,LOTR1,False
10708, frail and fleeting a little leave under the enduring shadow of the sentinel of nmenor ,LOTR1,False
10709, so they passed into the dark chasm of the gate ,LOTR1,False
10710, sheer rose the dreadful cliff to unguessed height on either side ,LOTR1,False
10711, far off wa the dim sky ,LOTR1,False
10712, the black water roared and echoed and a wind screamed over them ,LOTR1,False
10713, frodo crouching over hi knee heard sam in front muttering and groaning: what a place ,LOTR1,False
10714, just let me get out of thi boat and ill never wet my toe in a puddle again let alone a river ,LOTR1,False
10715, said a strange voice behind him ,LOTR1,False

10806, in steep place stair of stone had been hewn but now they were cracked and worn and split by the root of tree ,LOTR1,False

10809, the little upland lawn wa open upon the east and wa filled now with the early sunlight ,LOTR1,False

10811, the voice of rauro wa a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom ,LOTR1,False
10812, he sat down upon the stone and cupped hi chin in hi hand staring eastward but seeing little with hi eye ,LOTR1,False
10813, all that had happened since bilbo left the shire wa passing through hi mind and he recalled and pondered everything that he could remember of gandalf word ,LOTR1,False

10825, for i know what i should do but i am afraid of doing it boromir: afraid ,LOTR1,False
10826, the wind murmured in the branche of the tree ,LOTR1,False
10827, suddenly boromir came and sat beside him ,LOTR1,False
10828, are you sure that you do not suffer needlessly ,LOTR1,False
10829, i wish to help you ,LOTR1,False
10830, you need counsel in your hard choice ,LOTR1,False

10832,  i think i know already what counsel you would give boromir  said frodo ,LOTR1,False
10833, and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart ,LOTR1,False
10834, against the way that seem easier ,LOTR1,False
10835, against refusal of the burden that i laid on me ,LOTR1,False
10836, against well if it must be said against trust in the strength and truth of men ,LOTR1,False

10848, could i not have a sight of it again ,LOTR1,False

10852, i care not  said boromir ,LOTR1,False
10853, yet may i not even speak of it ,LOTR1,False

10856, mina tirith will fall if the ring last ,LOTR1,False

10878, the ring would give me power of command ,LOTR1,False
10879, how i would drive the host of mordor and all men would flock to my banner ,LOTR1,False
10880, boromir strode up and down speaking ever more loudly: almost he seemed to have forgotten frodo while hi talk dwelt on wall and weapon and the mustering of men; and he drew plan for great alliance and gloriou victorie to be; and he cast down mordor and became himself a mighty king benevolent and wise ,LOTR1,False
10881, suddenly he stopped and waved hi arm and they tell u to throw it away ,LOTR1,False

10885, surely you see it my friend ,LOTR1,False
10886, he said turning now suddenly to frodo again ,LOTR1,False

10906, will you not at least let me make trial of my plan ,LOTR1,False
10907, the council laid it upon me to bear it ,LOTR1,False
10908, it i by our own folly that the enemy will defeat u  cried boromir ,LOTR1,False
10909, running wilfully to death and mining our cause ,LOTR1,False

10912, it might have been mine ,LOTR1,False
10913, give it to me  ,LOTR1,False
10914,  frodo did not answer but moved away till the great flat stone stood between them ,LOTR1,False
10915,  said boromir in a softer voice ,LOTR1,False
10916, why not get rid of it ,LOTR1,False
10917, why not be free of your doubt and fear ,LOTR1,False
10918, you can lay the blame on me if you will ,LOTR1,False
10919, you can say that i wa too strong and took it by force ,LOTR1,False
10920, for i am too strong for you halfling  he cried; and suddenly he sprang over the stone and leaped at frodo ,LOTR1,False
10921, hi fair and pleasant face wa hideously changed; a raging fire wa in hi eye ,LOTR1,False
10922, frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them ,LOTR1,False
10923, there wa only one thing he could do: trembling he pulled out the ring upon it chain and quickly slipped it on hi finger even a boromir sprang at him again ,LOTR1,False
10924, the man gasped stared for a moment amazed and then ran wildly about seeking here and there among the rock and tree ,LOTR1,False

10929, curse you and all halfling to death and darkn  ,LOTR1,False
10930,  then catching hi foot on a stone he fell sprawling and lay upon hi face ,LOTR1,False
10931, for a while he wa a still a if hi own curse had struck him down; then suddenly he wept ,LOTR1,False
10932, he rose and passed hi hand over hi eye dashing away the tear ,LOTR1,False
10933, a madn took me but it ha passed ,LOTR1,False
10934,  there wa no answer ,LOTR1,False
10935, frodo did not even hear hi crie ,LOTR1,False
10936, he wa already far away leaping blindly up the path to the hill top ,LOTR1,False
10937, terror and grief shook him seeing in hi thought the mad fierce face of boromir and hi burning eye ,LOTR1,False
10938, soon he came out alone on the summit of amon hen and halted gasping for breath ,LOTR1,False
10939, he saw a through a mist a wide flat circle paved with mighty flag and surrounded with a crumbling battlement; and in the middle set upon four carven pillar wa a high seat reached by a stair of many step ,LOTR1,False

10941, at first he could see little ,LOTR1,False
10942, he seemed to be in a world of mist in which there were only shadows: the ring wa upon him ,LOTR1,False
10943, then here and there the mist gave way and he saw many visions: small and clear a if they were under hi eye upon a table and yet remote ,LOTR1,False
10944, there wa no sound only bright living image ,LOTR1,False
10945, the world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent ,LOTR1,False
10946, he wa sitting upon the seat of seeing on amon hen the hill of the eye of the men of nmenor ,LOTR1,False
10947, eastward he looked into wide uncharted land namel plain and forest unexplored ,LOTR1,False
10948, northward he looked and the great river lay like a ribbon beneath him and the misty mountain stood small and hard a broken teeth ,LOTR1,False
10949, westward he looked and saw the broad pasture of rohan; and orthanc the pinnacle of isengard like a black spike ,LOTR1,False
10950, southward he looked and below hi very feet the great river curled like a toppling wave and plunged over the fall of rauro into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume ,LOTR1,False

10992, thi at least i plain: the evil of the ring i already at work even in the company and the ring must leave them before it doe more harm ,LOTR1,False
10993, some i cannot trust and those i can trust are too dear to me: poor old sam and merry and pippin ,LOTR1,False
10994, strider too: hi heart yearn for mina tirith and he will be needed there now boromir ha fallen into evil ,LOTR1,False
10995, he went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where boromir had found him ,LOTR1,False
10996, he thought he could hear crie and call from the wood near the shore below ,LOTR1,False

11005, he vanished and passed down the hill l than a rustle of the wind ,LOTR1,False
11006, the other remained long by the river side ,LOTR1,False
11007, for some time they had been silent moving restlessly about; but now they were sitting in a circle and they were talking ,LOTR1,False
11008, every now and again they made effort to speak of other thing of their long road and many adventures; they questioned aragorn concerning the realm of gondor and it ancient history and the remnant of it great work that could still be seen in thi strange border land of the emyn muil: the stone king and the seat of lhaw and hen and the great stair beside the fall of rauro ,LOTR1,False
11009, but alway their thought and word strayed back to frodo and the ring ,LOTR1,False
11010, what would frodo choose to do ,LOTR1,False
11011, he i debating which course i the most desperate i think  said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
11012, it i now more hopel than ever for the company to go east since we have been tracked by gollum and must fear that the secret of our journey i already betrayed ,LOTR1,False
11013, but mina tirith i no nearer to the fire and the destruction of the burden ,LOTR1,False
11014, we may remain there for a while and make a brave stand; but the lord denethor and all hi men cannot hope to do what even elrond said wa beyond hi power: either to keep the burden secret or to hold off the full might of the enemy when he come to take it ,LOTR1,False
11015, which way would any of u choose in frodo place ,LOTR1,False
11016, now indeed we mis gandalf most ,LOTR1,False

11019, why cannot we decide and so help frodo ,LOTR1,False
11020, let u call him back and then vote ,LOTR1,False
11021, i should vote for mina tirith ,LOTR1,False
11022, and so should i  said gimli ,LOTR1,False
11023, we of course were only sent to help the bearer along the road to go no further than we wished; and none of u i under any oath or command to seek mount doom ,LOTR1,False
11024, hard wa my parting from lothlurien ,LOTR1,False
11025, yet i have come so far and i say this: now we have reached the last choice it i clear to me that i cannot leave frodo ,LOTR1,False
11026, i would choose mina tirith but if he doe not then i follow him ,LOTR1,False
11027, and i too will go with him  said legola ,LOTR1,False
11028, it would be faithl now to say farewell ,LOTR1,False
11029, it would indeed be a betrayal if we all left him  said aragorn ,LOTR1,False
11030, but if he goe east then all need not go with him; nor do i think that all should ,LOTR1,False
11031, that venture i desperate: a much so for eight a for three or two or one alone ,LOTR1,False
11032, if you would let me choose then i should appoint three companions: sam who could not bear it otherwise; and gimli; and myself ,LOTR1,False
11033, boromir will return to hi own city where hi father and hi people need him; and with him the other should go or at least meriadoc and peregrin if legola i not willing to leave u ,LOTR1,False
11034, that wont do at all ,LOTR1,False
11035, pippin and i alway intended to go wherever he went and we still do ,LOTR1,False
11036, but we did not realize what that would mean ,LOTR1,False
11037, it seemed different so far away in the shire or in ri vendell ,LOTR1,False
11038, it would be mad and cruel to let frodo go to mordor ,LOTR1,False
11039, why cant we stop him ,LOTR1,False

11041, and that i what he i worrying about i am sure ,LOTR1,False

11043, and he doesnt like to ask anyone to go with him poor old fellow ,LOTR1,False
11044, imagine it: going off to mordor alone ,LOTR1,False
11045, but the dear silly old hobbit he ought to know that he hasnt got to ask ,LOTR1,False

11072, i do not think that it i our part to drive him one way or the other ,LOTR1,False
11073, nor do i think that we should succeed if we tried ,LOTR1,False
