106, right and left of u they towered withthe afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing outall the gloriou colour of thi beautiful range deep blueand purple in the shadow of the peak green and brown wheregras and rock mingled and an endl perspective of jaggedrock and pointed crag till these were themselve lost inthe distance where the snowy peak rose grandly ,Dracula,False
107, here andthere seemed mighty rift in the mountain through which a the sun began to sink we saw now and again the whitegleam of falling water ,Dracula,False

120, sometime a the road wa cut through the pinewood that seemed in the darkn to be closing down uponu great masse of greyn which here and there bestrewedthe tree produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect which carried on the thought and grim fancie engenderedearlier in the evening when the falling sunset threw intostrange relief the ghost like cloud which amongst thecarpathian seem to wind ceaselessly through the valley ,Dracula,False
121,sometime the hill were so steep that despite our driver'shaste the horse could only go slowly ,Dracula,False
122, i wished to get downand walk up them a we do at home but the driver would nothear of it ,Dracula,False
123, you must not walk here ,Dracula,False
124, and then he added with what he evi dently meant for grim pleasantry for he looked round tocatch the approving smile of the rest and you may haveenough of such matter before you go to sleep ,Dracula,False
125, the onlystop he would make wa a moment' pause to light hi lamp ,Dracula,False
126,  when it grew dark there seemed to be some excitementamongst the passenger and they kept speaking to him oneafter the other a though urging him to further speed ,Dracula,False
127, helashed the horse unmercifully with hi long whip and withwild crie of encouragement urged them on to furtherexertion ,Dracula,False

136, these were certainly of an odd and varied kind buteach wa given in simple good faith with a kindly word anda blessing and that same strange mixture of fear meaningmovement which i had seen outside the hotel at bistritz the sign of the cros and the guard against the evil eye ,Dracula,False
137,then a we flew along the driver leaned forward and oneach side the passenger craning over the edge of the coach peered eagerly into the darkn ,Dracula,False
138, it wa evident that some thing very exciting wa either happening or expected butthough i asked each passenger no one would give me theslightest explanation ,Dracula,False
139, thi state of excitement kept on forsome little time ,Dracula,False

146, we could see now the sandy road lyingwhite before u but there wa on it no sign of a vehicle ,Dracula,False
147,the passenger drew back with a sigh of gladn whichseemed to mock my own disappointment ,Dracula,False
148, i wa already thinkingwhat i had best do when the driver looking at hi watch said to the other something which i could hardly hear itwa spoken so quietly and in so low a tone i thought it wasan hour l than the time ,Dracula,False

155, i couldsee from the flash of our lamp a the ray fell on them that the horse were coal black and splendid animal ,Dracula,False
156, theywere driven by a tall man with a long brown beard and agreat black hat which seemed to hide hi face from u ,Dracula,False
157, icould only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eye whichseemed red in the lamplight a he turned to u ,Dracula,False

169, hi strength must have been prodigiou ,Dracula,False
170,  without a word he shook hi rein the horse turned and we swept into the darkn of the pas ,Dracula,False
171, a i looked backi saw the steam from the horse of the coach by the lightof the lamp and projected against it the figure of my latecompanion crossing themselve ,Dracula,False
172, then the driver cracked hiswhip and called to hi horse and off they swept on theirway to bukovina ,Dracula,False
173, a they sank into the darkn i felt astrange chill and a lonely feeling come over me ,Dracula,False
174, but acloak wa thrown over my shoulder and a rug acros myknee and the driver said in excellent german  the night i chill mein herr and my master the countbade me take all care of you ,Dracula,False
175, there i a flask of slivovitz(the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat if youshould require it ,Dracula,False
176,  i did not take any but it wa a comfort to know it wasthere all the same ,Dracula,False
177, i felt a little strangely and not alittle frightened ,Dracula,False
178, i think had there been any alternative ishould have taken it instead of prosecuting that unknownnight journey ,Dracula,False
179, the carriage went at a hard pace straightalong then we made a complete turn and went along anotherstraight road ,Dracula,False
180, it seemed to me that we were simply goingover and over the same ground again and so i took note ofsome salient point and found that thi wa so ,Dracula,False
181, i would haveliked to have asked the driver what thi all meant but ireally feared to do so for i thought that placed a i wa any protest would have had no effect in case there had beenan intention to delay ,Dracula,False
182,  by and by however a i wa curiou to know how timewa passing i struck a match and by it flame looked at mywatch ,Dracula,False
183, it wa within a few minute of midnight ,Dracula,False
184, thi gave mea sort of shock for i suppose the general superstitionabout midnight wa increased by my recent experience ,Dracula,False
185, iwaited with a sick feeling of suspense ,Dracula,False
186,  then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse fardown the road a long agonized wailing a if from fear ,Dracula,False
187,the sound wa taken up by another dog and then another andanother till borne on the wind which now sighed softlythrough the pas a wild howling began which seemed to comefrom all over the country a far a the imagination couldgrasp it through the gloom of the night ,Dracula,False
188,  at the first howl the horse began to strain and rear but the driver spoke to them soothingly and they quieteddown but shivered and sweated a though after a runawayfrom sudden fright ,Dracula,False
189, then far off in the distance from themountain on each side of u began a louder and a sharperhowling that of wolve which affected both the horse andmyself in the same way ,Dracula,False
190, for i wa minded to jump from thecaleche and run whilst they reared again and plunged madly so that the driver had to use all hi great strength to keepthem from bolting ,Dracula,False
191, in a few minute however my own earsgot accustomed to the sound and the horse so far becamequiet that the driver wa able to descend and to stand be fore them ,Dracula,False
192,  he petted and soothed them and whispered something intheir ear a i have heard of horse tamer doing and withextraordinary effect for under hi caresse they becamequite manageable again though they still trembled ,Dracula,False
193, thedriver again took hi seat and shaking hi rein startedoff at a great pace ,Dracula,False
194, thi time after going to the far sideor the pas he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway whichran sharply to the right ,Dracula,False
195,  soon we were hemmed in with tree which in placesarched right over the roadway till we passed a through atunnel ,Dracula,False
196, and again great frowning rock guarded u boldly oneither side ,Dracula,False
197, though we were in shelter we could hear therising wind for it moaned and whistled through the rock and the branche of the tree crashed together a we sweptalong ,Dracula,False
198, it grew colder and colder still and fine powderysnow began to fall so that soon we and all around u werecovered with a white blanket ,Dracula,False
199, the keen wind still carriedthe howling of the dog though thi grew fainter a we wenton our way ,Dracula,False
200, the baying of the wolve sounded nearer and near er a though they were closing round on u from every side ,Dracula,False
201,i grew dreadfully afraid and the horse shared my fear ,Dracula,False
202, thedriver however wa not in the least disturbed ,Dracula,False
203,he kept turn ing hi head to left and right but i could not see anythingthrough the darkn ,Dracula,False
204,  suddenly away on our left i saw a fain flickering blueflame ,Dracula,False
205, the driver saw it at the same moment ,Dracula,False
206, he at oncechecked the horse and jumping to the ground disappearedinto the darkn ,Dracula,False
207, i did not know what to do the l asthe howling of the wolve grew closer ,Dracula,False
208, but while i wondered the driver suddenly appeared again and without a word tookhi seat and we resumed our journey ,Dracula,False
209, i think i must havefallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident for itseemed to be repeated endlessly and now looking back it islike a sort of awful nightmare ,Dracula,False
210, once the flame appeared sonear the road that even in the darkn around u i couldwatch the driver' motion ,Dracula,False
211, he went rapidly to where theblue flame arose it must have been very faint for it didnot seem to illumine the place around it at all and gather ing a few stone formed them into some device ,Dracula,False
212,  once there appeared a strange optical effect ,Dracula,False
213, when hestood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it for icould see it ghostly flicker all the same ,Dracula,False
214,thi startled me but a the effect wa only momentary i took it that my eyesdeceived me straining through the darkn ,Dracula,False
215, then for a timethere were no blue flame and we sped onward through thegloom with the howling of the wolve around u a thoughthey were following in a moving circle ,Dracula,False
216,  at last there came a time when the driver went furtherafield than he had yet gone and during hi absence thehorse began to tremble worse than ever and to snort andscream with fright ,Dracula,False
217,i could not see any cause for it for thehowling of the wolve had ceased altogether ,Dracula,False
218, but just thenthe moon sailing through the black cloud appeared behindthe jagged crest of a beetling pine clad rock and by itslight i saw around u a ring of wolve with white teeth andlolling red tongue with long sinewy limb and shaggy hair ,Dracula,False
219,they were a hundred time more terrible in the grim silencewhich held them than even when they howled ,Dracula,False
220, for myself ifelt a sort of paralysi of fear ,Dracula,False
221,it i only when a man feelshimself face to face with such horror that he can under stand their true import ,Dracula,False
222,  all at once the wolve began to howl a though the moon light had had some peculiar effect on them ,Dracula,False
223,the horse jumpedabout and reared and looked helplessly round with eye thatrolled in a way painful to see ,Dracula,False
224,but the living ring of terrorencompassed them on every side and they had perforce toremain within it ,Dracula,False
225, i called to the coachman to come for itseemed to me that our only chance wa to try to break outthrough the ring and to aid hi approach i shouted and beatthe side of the caleche hoping by the noise to scare thewolve from the side so a to give him a chance of reachingthe trap ,Dracula,False
226, how he came there i know not but i heard hisvoice raised in a tone of imperiou command and lookingtoward the sound saw him stand in the roadway ,Dracula,False
227, a he swepthi long arm a though brushing aside some impalpableobstacle the wolve fell back and back further still ,Dracula,False
228, justthen a heavy cloud passed acros the face of the moon sothat we were again in darkn ,Dracula,False
229,  when i could see again the driver wa climbing into thecaleche and the wolve disappeared ,Dracula,False
230, thi wa all so strangeand uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me and i wasafraid to speak or move ,Dracula,False
231, the time seemed interminable a weswept on our way now in almost complete darkn for therolling cloud obscured the moon ,Dracula,False
232,  we kept on ascending with occasional period of quickdescent but in the main alway ascending ,Dracula,False
233,suddenly i becameconsciou of the fact that the driver wa in the act of pull ing up the horse in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle from whose tall black window came no ray of light and whosebroken battlement showed a jagged line against the sky ,Dracula,False
234,chapter number  jonathan harker' journal continued  number may ,Dracula,False
235, i must have been asleep for certainly if i hadbeen fully awake i must have noticed the approach of such aremarkable place ,Dracula,False

237, i have not yet been able to see it by daylight ,Dracula,False
238,  when the caleche stopped the driver jumped down andheld out hi hand to assist me to alight ,Dracula,False
239, again i could notbut notice hi prodigiou strength ,Dracula,False
240, hi hand actually seemedlike a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he hadchosen ,Dracula,False
241, then he took my trap and placed them on the groundbeside me a i stood close to a great door old and studdedwith large iron nail and set in a projecting doorway ofmassive stone ,Dracula,False
242, i could see even in th e dim light that thestone wa massively carved but that the carving had beenmuch worn by time and weather ,Dracula,False
243, a i stood the driver jump ed again into hi seat and shook the rein ,Dracula,False
244,the horse start ed forward and trap and all disappeared down one of the darkopening ,Dracula,False

500, and opening thewindow with one wrench of hi terrible hand he flung outthe glas which wa shattered into a thousand piece onthe stone of the courtyard far below ,Dracula,False
501, then he withdrewwithout a word ,Dracula,False
502, it i very annoying for i do not see howi am to shave unl in my watch case or the bottom ofthe shaving pot which i fortunately of metal ,Dracula,False
503,  when i went into the dining room breakfast wa pre pared but i could not find the count anywhere ,Dracula,False
504, so i break fasted alone ,Dracula,False
505, it i strange that a yet i have not seen thecount eat or drink ,Dracula,False
506, he must be a very peculiar man ,Dracula,False
507, afterbreakfast i did a little exploring in the castle ,Dracula,False
508, i went outon the stair and found a room looking toward the south ,Dracula,False
509,  the view wa magnificent and from where i stood therewa every opportunity of seeing it ,Dracula,False
510, the castle i on thevery edge of a terrific precipice ,Dracula,False
511, a stone falling from thewindow would fall a thousand feet without touching anything ,Dracula,False
512,a far a the eye can reach i a sea of green tree top withoccasionally a deep rift where there i a chasm ,Dracula,False
513, here andthere are silver thread where the river wind in deepgorge through the forest ,Dracula,False
514,  but i am not in heart to describe beauty for when i hadseen the view i explored further ,Dracula,False

520, when i look back after a few hour ithink i must have been mad for the time for i behaved mucha a rat doe in a trap ,Dracula,False
521, when however the conviction hadcome to me that i wa helpl i sat down quietly a quiet ly a i have ever done anything in my life and began tothink over what wa best to be done ,Dracula,False
522, i am thinking still and a yet have come to no definite conclusion ,Dracula,False
523, of one thingonly am i certain ,Dracula,False
524, that it i no use making my idea knownto the count ,Dracula,False
525, he know well that i am imprisoned and a heha done it himself and ha doubtl hi own motive forit he would only deceive me if i trusted him fully with thefact ,Dracula,False
526, so far a i can see my only plan will be to keep myknowledge and my fear to myself and my eye open ,Dracula,False
527, i am iknow either being deceived like a baby by my own fear or else i am in desperate strait and if the latter be so i need and shall need all my brain to get through ,Dracula,False
528,  i had hardly come to thi conclusion when i heard thegreat door below shut and knew that the count had returned ,Dracula,False
529,he did not come at once into the library so i went cau tiously to my own room and found him making the bed ,Dracula,False
530, thiswa odd but only confirmed what i had all along thought that there are no servant in the house ,Dracula,False

535, what meant the giving of the crucifix of the garlic of the wild rose of the mountain ash ,Dracula,False
536,  bl that good good woman who hung the crucifix roundmy neck ,Dracula,False
537, for it i a comfort and a strength to me whenever itouch it ,Dracula,False
538, it i odd that a thing which i have been taught toregard with disfavour and a idolatrou should in a time oflonelin and trouble be of help ,Dracula,False
539, i it that there i some thing in the essence of the thing itself or that it i amedium a tangible help in conveying memorie of sympathyand comfort ,Dracula,False
540, some time if it may be i must examine thismatter and try to make up my mind about it ,Dracula,False

572, blood i too preciou a thing inthese day of dishonourable peace and the glorie of thegreat race are a a tale that i told ,Dracula,False
573,  it wa by thi time close on morning and we went tobed ,Dracula,False
574, thi diary seem horribly like the beginning ofthe arabian night for everything ha to break off atcockcrow or like the ghost of hamlet' father ,Dracula,False
575, let me begin with fact bare meager fact verified by book and figure and of which there can be nodoubt ,Dracula,False
576, i must not confuse them with experience which willhave to rest on my own observation or my memory of them ,Dracula,False
577,last evening when the count came from hi room he began byasking me question on legal matter and on the doing ofcertain kind of busin ,Dracula,False
578, i had spent the day wearily overbook and simply to keep my mind occupied went over someof the matter i had been examined in at lincoln' inn ,Dracula,False
579,therewa a certain method in the count' inquirie so i shalltry to put them down in sequence ,Dracula,False
580, the knowledge may somehowor some time be useful to me ,Dracula,False
581,  first he asked if a man in england might have two so licitor or more ,Dracula,False
582, i told him he might have a dozen if hewished but that it would not be wise to have more than onesolicitor engaged in one transaction a only one could actat a time and that to change would be certain to militateagainst hi interest ,Dracula,False
583, he seemed thoroughly to understand and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficul ty in having one man to attend say to banking and anotherto look after shipping in case local help were needed in aplace far from the home of the banking solicitor ,Dracula,False
584, i askedto explain more fully so that i might not by any chancemislead him so he said i shall illustrate ,Dracula,False
585, your friend and mine mr peterhawkin from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedralat exeter which i far from london buy for me throughyour good self my place at london ,Dracula,False
586, now here let mesay frankly lest you should think it strange that i havesought the service of one so far off from london instead ofsome one resident there that my motive wa that no localinterest might be served save my wish only and a one oflondon residence might perhap have some purpose of himselfor friend to serve i went thu afield to seek my agent whose labour should be only to my interest ,Dracula,False
587, now suppose i who have much of affair wish to ship good say to new castle or durham or harwich or dover might it not be thatit could with more ease be done by consigning to one inthese ports ,Dracula,False
588,  i answered that certainly it would be most easy butthat we solicitor had a system of agency one for the other so that local work could be done locally on instruction fromany solicitor so that the client simply placing himselfin the hand of one man could have hi wishe carried outby him without further trouble ,Dracula,False
589,  but said he i could be at liberty to direct myself ,Dracula,False
590,  of course i replied and such i often done by menof busin who do not like the whole of their affair to beknown by any one person ,Dracula,False
591, he said and then went on to ask about the meansof making consignment and the form to be gone through andof all sort of difficultie which might arise but by fore thought could be guarded against ,Dracula,False
592, i explained all thesething to him to the best of my ability and he certainlyleft me under the impression that he would have made awonderful solicitor for there wa nothing that he did notthink of or foresee ,Dracula,False
593, for a man who wa never in the country and who did not evidently do much in the way of busin hisknowledge and acumen were wonderful ,Dracula,False
594, when he had satisfiedhimself on these point of which he had spoken and i hadverified all a well a i could by the book available hesuddenly stood up and said have you written since yourfirst letter to our friend mr peter hawkin or to anyother ,Dracula,False

602, it wa mrhawkins'interest not mine and i had to think of him not myself and beside while count dracula wa speaking there wasthat in hi eye and in hi bearing which made me rememberthat i wa a prisoner and that if i wished it i could haveno choice ,Dracula,False
603, the count saw hi victory in my bow and hi mas tery in the trouble of my face for he began at once to usethem but in hi own smooth resistl way ,Dracula,False

608, so i determined to write only formal note now butto write fully to mr hawkin in secret and also to mina for to her i could write shorthand which would puzzle thecount if he did see it ,Dracula,False
609, when i had written my two letter isat quiet reading a book whilst the count wrote severalnote referring a he wrote them to some book on hi table ,Dracula,False
610,then he took up my two and placed them with hi own and putby hi writing material after which the instant the doorhad closed behind him i leaned over and looked at the lett er which were face down on the table ,Dracula,False

641, there wa peaceand comfort in every breath i drew ,Dracula,False
642,a i leaned from the win dow my eye wa caught by something moving a storey below me and somewhat to my left where i imagined from the order ofthe room that the window of the count' own room wouldlook out ,Dracula,False
643, the window at which i stood wa tall and deep stone mullioned and though weatherworn wa still complete ,Dracula,False
644,but it wa evidently many a day since the case had beenthere ,Dracula,False
645,i drew back behind the stonework and looked carefullyout ,Dracula,False
646,  what i saw wa the count' head coming out from thewindow ,Dracula,False
647, i did not see the face but i knew the man by theneck and the movement of hi back and arm in any case icould not mistake the hand which i had had some many oppor tunitie of studying ,Dracula,False
648, i wa at first interested and somewhatamused for it i wonderful how small a matter will interestand amuse a man when he i a prisoner ,Dracula,False
649, but my very feelingschanged to repulsion and terror when i saw the whole manslowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down thecastle wall over the dreadful abys face down with hi cloakspreading out around him like great wing ,Dracula,False
650, at first i couldnot believe my eye ,Dracula,False
651,i thought it wa some trick of the moon light some weird effect of shadow but i kept looking andit could be no delusion ,Dracula,False
652,i saw the finger and toe grasp thecorner of the stone worn clear of the mortar by the stressof year and by thu using every projection and inequalitymove downward with considerable speed just a a lizardmove along a wall ,Dracula,False

659, he vanishedinto some hole or window ,Dracula,False
660, when hi head had disappeared ileaned out to try and see more but without avail ,Dracula,False
661, the dis tance wa too great to allow a proper angle of sight ,Dracula,False
662, i knewhe had left the castle now and thought to use the opportun ity to explore more than i had dared to do a yet ,Dracula,False
663, i wentback to the room and taking a lamp tried all the door ,Dracula,False
664,they were all locked a i had expected and the lock werecomparatively new ,Dracula,False

671, one or twosmall room near the hall were open but there wa nothingto see in them except old furniture dusty with age andmoth eaten ,Dracula,False
672, at last however i found one door at the top ofthe stairway which though it seemed locked gave a littleunder pressure ,Dracula,False
673, i tried it harder and found that it wa notreally locked but that the resistance came from the factthat the hinge had fallen somewhat and the heavy door rest ed on the floor ,Dracula,False
674, here wa an opportunity which i might nothave again so i exerted myself and with many effort forcedit back so that i could enter ,Dracula,False

1578, thesteamer emma and scarborough made trip up and down thecoast and there wa an unusual amount of `tripping' bothto and from whitby ,Dracula,False
1579, the day wa unusually fine till theafternoon when some of the gossip who frequent the eastcliff churchyard and from the commanding eminence watchthe wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east calledattention to a sudden show of `mare tails' high in the skyto the northwest ,Dracula,False
1580, the wind wa then blowing from the south west in the mild degree which in barometrical language isranked `no ,Dracula,False
1581,'  the coastguard on duty at once made report and one oldfisherman who for more than half a century ha kept watch onweather sign from the east cliff foretold in an emphaticmanner the coming of a sudden storm ,Dracula,False
1582, the approach of sunsetwa so very beautiful so grand in it masse of splendidlycoloured cloud that there wa quite an assemblage on thewalk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy thebeauty ,Dracula,False
1583,before the sun dipped below the black mas of kettle n standing boldly athwart the western sky it downwardwa wa marked by myriad cloud of every sunset colour flame purple pink green violet and all the tint ofgold with here and there masse not large but of seeminglyabsolute blackn in all sort of shape a well outlineda colossal silhouette ,Dracula,False
1584, the experience wa not lost on thepainter and doubtl some of the sketche of the `preludeto the great storm' will grace the r ,Dracula,False
1585,  more than one captain made up hi mind then and therethat hi `cobble' or hi `mule' a they term the differentclasse of boat would remain in the harbour till the stormhad passed ,Dracula,False
1586, the wind fell away entirely during the evening and at midnight there wa a dead calm a sultry heat andthat prevailing intensity which on the approach of thunder affect person of a sensitive nature ,Dracula,False
1587,  there were but few light in sight at sea for eventhe coasting steamer which usually hug the shore so closely kept well to seaward and but few fishing boat were in sight ,Dracula,False
1588,the only sail noticeable wa a foreign schooner with allsail set which wa seemingly going westward ,Dracula,False
1589,the foolhard in or ignorance of her officer wa a prolific theme forcomment whilst she remained in sight and effort were madeto signal her to reduce sail in the face of her danger ,Dracula,False
1590, be fore the night shut down she wa seen with sail idly flapp ing a she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea ,Dracula,False
1591,  a idle a a painted ship upon a painted ocean ,Dracula,False
1592,  shortly before ten o'clock the stilln of the airgrew quite oppressive and the silence wa so marked that thebleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in thetown wa distinctly heard and the band on the pier withit lively french air wa like a dischord in the great har mony of nature' silence ,Dracula,False
1593, a little after midnight came astrange sound from over the sea and high overhead the airbegan to carry a strange faint hollow booming ,Dracula,False
1594,  then without warning the tempest broke ,Dracula,False
1595, with a rapiditywhich at the time seemed incredible and even afterward isimpossible to realize the whole aspect of nature at oncebecame convulsed ,Dracula,False
1596, the wave rose in growing fury each over topping it fellow till in a very few minute the latelyglassy sea wa like a roaring and devouring monster ,Dracula,False
1597, white crested wave beat madly on the level sand and rushed upthe shelving cliff ,Dracula,False
1598, other broke over the pier and withtheir spume swept the lanthorn of the lighthouse whichrise from the end of either pier of whitby harbour ,Dracula,False
1599,  the wind roared like thunder and blew with such forcethat it wa with difficulty that even strong men kept theirfeet or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchion ,Dracula,False
1600, itwa found necessary to clear the entire pier from the massof onlooker or else the fatalitie of the night would haveincreased manifold ,Dracula,False
1601, to add to the difficultie and dangersof the time masse of sea fog came drifting inland ,Dracula,False
1602, white wet cloud which swept by in ghostly fashion so dank anddamp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagina tion to think that the spirit of those lost at sea weretouching their living brethren with the clammy hand ofdeath and many a one shuddered at the wreath of sea mistswept by ,Dracula,False
1603,  at time the mist cleared and the sea for some dis tance could be seen in the glare of the lightning whichcame thick and fast followed by such peal of thunder thatthe whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock ofthe footstep of the storm ,Dracula,False
1604,  some of the scene thu revealed were of immeasurablegrandeur and of absorbing interest ,Dracula,False
1605, the sea running mount ain high threw skyward with each wave mighty masse ofwhite foam which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirlaway into space ,Dracula,False
1606, here and there a fishing boat with a ragof sail running madly for shelter before the blast now andagain the white wing of a storm tossed seabird ,Dracula,False
1607, on thesummit of the east cliff the new searchlight wa ready forexperiment but had not yet been tried ,Dracula,False
1608, the officer incharge of it got it into working order and in the pause ofonrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea ,Dracula,False
1609, once ortwice it service wa most effective a when a fishing boat with gunwale under water rushed into the harbour able bythe guidance of the sheltering light to avoid the danger ofdashing against the pier ,Dracula,False
1610, a each boat achieved the safetyof the port there wa a shout of joy from the mas of peopleon the shore a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave thegale and wa then swept away in it rush ,Dracula,False
1611,  before long the searchlight discovered some distanceaway a schooner with all sail set apparently the same ves sel which had been noticed earlier in the evening ,Dracula,False
1612, the windhad by thi time backed to the east and there wa a shudderamongst the watcher on the cliff a they realized the terr ible danger in which she now wa ,Dracula,False
1613,  between her and the port lay the great flat reef onwhich so many good ship have from time to time suffered and with the wind blowing from it present quarter it wouldbe quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance ofthe harbour ,Dracula,False
1614,  it wa now nearly the hour of high tide but the waveswere so great that in their trough the shallow of theshore were almost visible and the schooner with all sailsset wa rushing with such speed that in the word of oneold salt she must fetch up somewhere if it wa only inhell ,Dracula,False
1615, then came another rush of sea fog greater than anyhitherto a mas of dank mist which seemed to close on allthing like a gray pall and left available to men only theorgan of hearing for the roar of the tempest and the crashof the thunder and the booming of the mighty billow camethrough the damp oblivion even louder than before ,Dracula,False
1616, the raysof the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouthacros the east pier where the shock wa expected and menwaited breathl ,Dracula,False
1617,  the wind suddenly shifted to the northeast and theremnant of the sea fog melted in the blast ,Dracula,False
1618, and then mirabile dictu between the pier leaping from wave to wavea it rushed at headlong speed swept the strange schoonerbefore the blast with all sail set and gained the safetyof the harbour ,Dracula,False
1619, the searchlight followed her and a shudderran through all who saw her for lashed to the helm wa acorpse with drooping head which swung horribly to and froat each motion of the ship ,Dracula,False
1620, no other form could be seen onthe deck at all ,Dracula,False
1621,  a great awe came on all a they realised that the ship a if by a miracle had found the harbour unsteered save bythe hand of a dead man ,Dracula,False
1622, however all took place more quicklythan it take to write these word ,Dracula,False
1623, the schooner paused not but rushing acros the harbour pitched herself on thataccumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tide andmany storm into the southeast corner of the pier juttingunder the east cliff known locally a tate hill pier ,Dracula,False
1624,  there wa of course a considerable concussion a thevessel drove up on the sand heap ,Dracula,False
1625, every spar rope and staywa strained and some of the `top hammer' came crashing down ,Dracula,False
1626,but strangest of all the very instant the shore wa touched an immense dog sprang up on deck from below a if shot up bythe concussion and running forward jumped from the bow onthe sand ,Dracula,False
1627,  making straight for the steep cliff where the church yard hang over the laneway to the east pier so steeply thatsome of the flat tombstone thruffstean or through stone a they call them in whitby vernacular actually projectover where the sustaining cliff ha fallen away it disa ppeared in the darkn which seemed intensified justbeyond the focu of the searchlight ,Dracula,False
1628,  it so happened that there wa no one at the moment ontate hill pier a all those whose house are in close prox imity were either in bed or were out on the height above ,Dracula,False
1629,thu the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the har bour who at once ran down to the little pier wa the firstto climb aboard ,Dracula,False
1630, the men working the searchlight afterscouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there ,Dracula,False
1631, thecoastguard ran aft and when he came beside the wheel bentover to examine it and recoiled at once a though under somesudden emotion ,Dracula,False
1632, thi seemed to pique general curiosity andquite a number of people began to run ,Dracula,False
1633,  it i a good way round from the west cliff by the draw bridge to tate hill pier but your correspondent i a fairlygood runner and came well ahead of the crowd ,Dracula,False
1634, when i arri ved however i found already assembled on the pier a crowd whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come onboard ,Dracula,False
1635, by the courtesy of the chief boatman i wa a yourcorrespondent permitted to climb on deck and wa one of asmall group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashedto the wheel ,Dracula,False
1636,  it wa no wonder that the coastguard wa surprised oreven awed for not often can such a sight have been seen ,Dracula,False
1637,the man wa simply fastened by hi hand tied one over theother to a spoke of the wheel ,Dracula,False
1638, between the inner hand andthe wood wa a crucifix the set of bead on which it wasfastened being around both wrist and wheel and all keptfast by the binding cord ,Dracula,False
1639, the poor fellow may have beenseated at one time but the flapping and buffeting of thesail had worked through the rudder of the wheel and haddragged him to and fro so that the cord with which hewa tied had cut the flesh to the bone ,Dracula,False
1640,  accurate note wa made of the state of thing and adoctor surgeon j ,Dracula,False
1641, caffyn of number east elliot place whocame immediately after me declared after making examina tion that the man must have been dead for quite two day ,Dracula,False
1642,  in hi pocket wa a bottle carefully corked emptysave for a little roll of paper which proved to be theaddendum to the log ,Dracula,False
1643,  the coastguard said the man must have tied up hi ownhand fastening the knot with hi teeth ,Dracula,False
1644, the fact that acoastguard wa the first on board may save some complica tion later on in the admiralty court for coastguardscannot claim the salvage which i the right of the firstcivilian entering on a derelict ,Dracula,False
1645, already however the legaltongue are wagging and one young law student i loudlyasserting that the right of the owner are already complete ly sacrificed hi property being held in contravention ofthe statue of mortmain since the tiller a emblemship ifnot proof of delegated possession i held in a dead hand ,Dracula,False
1646,  it i needl to say that the dead steersman ha beenreverently removed from the place where he held hi honour able watch and ward till death a steadfastn a noble asthat of the young casabianca and placed in the mortuary toawait inquest ,Dracula,False

3281,  when i got back quincey wa waiting for me ,Dracula,False
3282, i told himi would see him a soon a i knew about lucy and went up toher room ,Dracula,False
3283, she wa still sleeping and the professor seeminglyhad not moved from hi seat at her side ,Dracula,False
3284, from hi putting hisfinger to hi lip i gathered that he expected her to wakebefore long and wa afraid of fore stalling nature ,Dracula,False
3285, so i wentdown to quincey and took him into the breakfast room wherethe blind were not drawn down and which wa a little morecheerful or rather l cheerl than the other room  when we were alone he said to me jack seward i don'twant to shove myself in anywhere where i've no right to be but thi i no ordinary case ,Dracula,False
3286, you know i loved that girl andwanted to marry her but although that' all past and gone ican't help feeling anxiou about her all the same ,Dracula,False
3287, what isit that' wrong with her ,Dracula,False
3288, the dutchman and a fine old fellowi i i can see that said that time you two came into theroom that you must have another transfusion of blood andthat both you and he were exhausted ,Dracula,False
3289, now i know well that youmedical men speak in camera and that a man must not expectto know what they consult about in private ,Dracula,False
3290, but thi i nocommon matter and whatever it i i have done my part ,Dracula,False
3291,  that' so i said and he went on ,Dracula,False
3292,  i take it that both you and van helsing had done al ready what i did today ,Dracula,False
3293,  and i gu art wa in it too ,Dracula,False
3294, when i saw him fourday ago down at hi own place he looked queer ,Dracula,False
3295, i have notseen anything pulled down so quick since i wa on the pampasand had a mare that i wa fond of go to gras all in a night ,Dracula,False
3296,one of those big bat that they call vampire had got at herin the night and what with hi gorge and the vein left open there wasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up and ihad to put a bullet through her a she lay ,Dracula,False
3297, jack if youmay tell me without betraying confidence arthur wa thefirst i not that so ,Dracula,False
3298,  a he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxiou ,Dracula,False
3299, hewa in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved and hi utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seem ed to surround her intensified hi pain ,Dracula,False
3300, hi very heartwa bleeding and it took all the manhood of him and therewa a royal lot of it too to keep him from breaking down ,Dracula,False
3301,i paused before answering for i felt that i must not betrayanything which the professor wished kept secret but alreadyhe knew so much and guessed so much that there could be noreason for not answering so i answered in the same phrase ,Dracula,False
3302,  and how long ha thi been going on ,Dracula,False
3303, then i gu jack seward that that poorpretty creature that we all love ha had put into her veinswithin that time the blood of four strong men ,Dracula,False
3304, man alive her whole body wouldn't hold it ,Dracula,False
3305, then coming close to me he spoke in a fierce half whisper ,Dracula,False
3306,  i shook my head ,Dracula,False
3307, that i said i the crux ,Dracula,False
3308, vanhelsing i simply frantic about it and i am at my wits' end ,Dracula,False
3309,i can't even hazard a gu ,Dracula,False
3310, there ha been a serie oflittle circumstance which have thrown out all our calcula tion a to lucy being properly watched ,Dracula,False
3311, but these shallnot occur again ,Dracula,False
3312, here we stay until all be well or ill ,Dracula,False
3313,  quincey held out hi hand ,Dracula,False
3314, count me in he said ,Dracula,False
3315, youand the dutchman will tell me what to do and i'll do it ,Dracula,False
3316,  when she woke late in the afternoon lucy' first move ment wa to feel in her breast and to my surprise producedthe paper which van helsing had given me to read ,Dracula,False
3317, the care ful professor had replaced it where it had come from leston waking she should be alarmed ,Dracula,False
3318, her eye then lit on vanhelsing and on me too and gladdened ,Dracula,False
3319, then she looked roundthe room and seeing where she wa shuddered ,Dracula,False
3320, she gave aloud cry and put her poor thin hand before her pale face ,Dracula,False
3321,  we both understood what wa meant that she had real ized to the full her mother' death ,Dracula,False
3322, so we tried what wecould to comfort her ,Dracula,False
3323, doubtl sympathy eased her somewhat but she wa very low in thought and spirit and wept silentlyand weakly for a long time ,Dracula,False
3324, we told her that either or bothof u would now remain with her all the time and that seemedto comfort her ,Dracula,False
3325, toward dusk she fell into a doze ,Dracula,False
3326, here avery odd thing occurred ,Dracula,False
3327, whilst still asleep she took thepaper from her breast and tore it in two ,Dracula,False
3328,van helsing steppedover and took the piece from her ,Dracula,False
3329, all the same however she went on with the action of tearing a though the mater ial were still in her hand ,Dracula,False
3330, finally she lifted her handsand opened them a though scattering the fragment ,Dracula,False
3331, vanhelsing seemed surprised and hi brow gathered a if inthought but he said nothing ,Dracula,False
3332, all last night she slept fitfully beingalway afraid to sleep and something weaker when she wokefrom it ,Dracula,False
3333, the professor and i took in turn to watch and wenever left her for a moment unattended ,Dracula,False
3334, quincey morri saidnothing about hi intention but i knew that all night longhe patrolled round and round the house ,Dracula,False
3335,  when the day came it searching light showed the rav age in poor lucy' strength ,Dracula,False
3336, she wa hardly able to turnher head and the little nourishment which she could takeseemed to do her no good ,Dracula,False
3337, at time she slept and both vanhelsing and i noticed the difference in her between sleep ing and waking ,Dracula,False
3338, whilst asleep she looked stronger althoughmore haggard and her breathing wa softer ,Dracula,False
3339, her open mouthshowed the pale gum drawn back from the teeth which lookedpositively longer and sharper than usual ,Dracula,False
3340, when she woke thesoftn of her eye evidently changed the expression forshe looked her own self although a dying one ,Dracula,False
3341, in the after noon she asked for arthur and we telegraphed for him ,Dracula,False

3446,youshall lie on one and i on the other and our sympathy willbe comfort to each other even though we do not speak andeven if we sleep ,Dracula,False
3447,  arthur went off with him casting back a longing lookon lucy' face which lay in her pillow almost whiter thanthe lawn ,Dracula,False
3448, she lay quite still and i looked around the roomto see that all wa a it should be ,Dracula,False
3449, i could see that theprofessor had carried out in thi room a in the other hispurpose of using the garlic ,Dracula,False
3450, the whole of the window sashesreeked with it and round lucy' neck over the silk hand kerchief which van helsing made her keep on wa a roughchaplet of the same odorou flower ,Dracula,False
3451,  lucy wa breathing somewhat stertorously and her facewa at it worst for the open mouth showed the pale gumsher teeth in the dim uncertain light seemed longer andsharper than they had been in the morning ,Dracula,False
3452, in particular by some trick of the light the canine teeth looked longerand sharper than the rest ,Dracula,False
3453,  i sat down beside her and presently she moved uneas ily ,Dracula,False
3454, at the same moment there came a sort of dull flappingor buffeting at the window ,Dracula,False
3455, i went over to it softly andpeeped out by the corner of the blind ,Dracula,False
3456, there wa a fullmoonlight and i could see that the noise wa made by a greatbat which wheeled around doubtl attracted by the light although so dim and every now and again struck the windowwith it wing ,Dracula,False

3461,there did not seem to be with her now the unconsciou strug gle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked herilln ,Dracula,False
3462, it struck me a curiou that the moment she becameconsciou she pressed the garlic flower close to her ,Dracula,False
3463, itwa certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargicstate with the stertorou breathing she put the flowersfrom her but that when she waked she clutched them close there wa no possibility of making amy mistake about thi for in the long hour that followed she had many spellsof sleeping and waking and repeated both action many time ,Dracula,False
3464,  at six o'clock van helsing came to relieve me ,Dracula,False

3481, i assured him that lucy wa still asleep but told him a gently a i could that both van helsing andi feared that the end wa near ,Dracula,False

3493,  so arthur took her hand and knelt beside her and shelooked her best with all the soft line matching the angelicbeauty of her eye ,Dracula,False
3494, then gradually her eye closed and shesank to sleep ,Dracula,False
3495, for a little bit her breast heaved softly and her breath came and went like a tired child' ,Dracula,False

3504,  i kept my eye fixed on lucy a did van helsing andwe saw a spasm a of rage flit like a shadow over her face ,Dracula,False

3613, here wa a poorgirl putting aside the terror which she naturally had ofdeath to go watch alone by the bier of the mistr whom sheloved so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laidto eternal rest ,Dracula,False
3614,  i must have slept long and soundly for it wa broaddaylight when van helsing waked me by coming into my room ,Dracula,False
3615,he came over to my bedside and said you need not troubleabout the knive ,Dracula,False
3616, we shall not do it ,Dracula,False
3617, for hi solemnity of the nightbefore had greatly impressed me ,Dracula,False
3618,  because he said sternly it i too late or tooearly ,Dracula,False
3619, here he held up the little golden crucifix ,Dracula,False
3620,  thi wa stolen in the night ,Dracula,False
3621,  how stolen i asked in wonder since you have it now ,Dracula,False
3622,  because i get it back from the worthl wretch whostole it from the woman who robbed the dead and the living ,Dracula,False

3624, sheknew not altogether what she did and thu unknowing sheonly stole ,Dracula,False
3625, he went away on the word leaving me with a new mystery to think of a new puzzle tograpple with ,Dracula,False
3626,  the forenoon wa a dreary time but at noon the solici tor came mrmarquand of wholeman son marquand & lidder dale ,Dracula,False
3627, he wa very genial and very appreciative of what wehad done and took off our hand all care a to detail ,Dracula,False
3628,during lunch he told u that mr ,Dracula,False
3629, westenra had for some timeexpected sudden death from her heart and had put her affairsin absolute order ,Dracula,False
3630, he informed u that with the exceptionof a certain entailed property of lucy' father which now in default of direct issue went back to a distant branch ofthe family the whole estate real and personal wa leftabsolutely to arthur holmwood ,Dracula,False
3631, when he had told u so muchhe went on frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentarydisposition and pointed out certain contingencie that mightleave her daughter either pennil or not so free a sheshould be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance ,Dracula,False
3632, indeed we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into colli sion for she asked u if we were or were not prepared tocarry out her wishe ,Dracula,False
3633, of course we had then no alternativebut to accept ,Dracula,False
3634, we were right in principle and ninety ninetime out of a hundred we should have proved by the logic ofevent the accuracy of our judgment ,Dracula,False
3635,  frankly however i must admit that in thi case anyother form of disposition would have rendered impossible thecarrying out of her wishe ,Dracula,False
3636, for by her predeceasing herdaughter the latter would have come into possession of theproperty and even had she only survived her mother by fiveminute her property would in case there were no will anda will wa a practical impossibility in such a case havebeen treated at her decease a under intestacy ,Dracula,False
3637, in whichcase lord godalming though so dear a friend would have hadno claim in the world ,Dracula,False
3638, and the inheritor being remote would not be likely to abandon their just right for senti mental reason regarding an entire stranger ,Dracula,False
3639, i assure you my dear sir i am rejoiced at the result perfectly rejoiced ,Dracula,False
3640,  he wa a good fellow but hi rejoicing at the onelittle part in which he wa officially interested of sogreat a tragedy wa an object lesson in the limitation ofsympathetic understanding ,Dracula,False
3641,  he did not remain long but said he would look in laterin the day and see lord godalming ,Dracula,False

4242, dare you come with me ,Dracula,False
4243, a man doe not like to prove such atruth byron excepted from the catagory jealousy ,Dracula,False

4253, we shall tellhim nothing but only that we wish to learn ,Dracula,False
4254,  he took a key from hi pocket and held it up ,Dracula,False
4255, and thenwe spend the night you and i in the churchyard where lucylie ,Dracula,False
4256, thi i the key that lock the tomb ,Dracula,False
4257, i had it from thecoffin man to give to arthur ,Dracula,False
4258,  my heart sank within me for i felt that there wa somefearful ordeal before u ,Dracula,False
4259, i could do nothing however so iplucked up what heart i could and said that we had betterhasten a the afternoon wa passing ,Dracula,False
4260,  we found the child awake ,Dracula,False
4261, it had had a sleep and takensome food and altogether wa going on well ,Dracula,False
4262, dr vincenttook the bandage from it throat and showed u the punct ure ,Dracula,False
4263, there wa no mistaking the similarity to those whichhad been on lucy' throat ,Dracula,False
4264, they were smaller and the edgeslooked fresher that wa all ,Dracula,False
4265, we asked vincent to what heattributed them and he replied that it must have been abite of some animal perhap a rat but for hi own part hewa inclined to think it wa one of the bat which are sonumerou on the northern height of london ,Dracula,False
4266, out of so manyharml one he said there may be some wild specimenfrom the south of a more malignant specie ,Dracula,False
4267, some sailor mayhave brought one home and it managed to escape or even fromthe zoological garden a young one may have got loose or onebe bred there from a vampire ,Dracula,False
4268, these thing do occur you know ,Dracula,False
4269, only ten day ago a wolf got out and wa i believe traced up in thi direction ,Dracula,False
4270, for a week after the childrenwere playing nothing but red riding hood on the heath and inevery alley in the place until thi `bloofer lady' scarecame along since then it ha been quite a gala time withthem ,Dracula,False
4271, even thi poor little mite when he woke up today asked the nurse if he might go away ,Dracula,False
4272, when she asked him whyhe wanted to go he said he wanted to play with the `blooferlady' ,Dracula,False
4273,  i hope said van helsing that when you are sendingthe child home you will caution it parent to keep strictwatch over it ,Dracula,False
4274, these fancie to stray are most dangerou and if the child were to remain out another night it wouldprobably be fatal ,Dracula,False
4275, but in any case i suppose you will notlet it away for some days ,Dracula,False
4276,  certainly not not for a week at least longer if thewound i not healed ,Dracula,False
4277,  our visit to the hospital took more time than we hadreckoned on and the sun had dipped before we came out ,Dracula,False
4278, whenvan helsing saw how dark it wa he said there i not hurry ,Dracula,False
4279, it i more late than i thought ,Dracula,False
4280,come let u seek somewhere that we may eat and then weshall go on our way ,Dracula,False
4281,  we dined at `jack straw' castle' along with a littlecrowd of bicyclist and other who were genially noisy ,Dracula,False
4282,aboutten o'clock we started from the inn ,Dracula,False
4283, it wa then very dark and the scattered lamp made the darkn greater when wewere once outside their individual radiu ,Dracula,False
4284, the professor hadevidently noted the road we were to go for he went on un hesitatingly but a for me i wa in quite a mixup a tolocality ,Dracula,False
4285, a we went further we met fewer and fewer people till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even thepatrol of horse police going their usual suburban round ,Dracula,False
4286, atlast we reached the wall of the churchyard which we climbedover ,Dracula,False
4287, with some little difficulty for it wa very dark andthe whole place seemed so strange to u we found the west enra tomb ,Dracula,False
4288, the professor took the key opened the creakydoor and standing back politely but quite unconsciously motioned me to precede him ,Dracula,False
4289, there wa a deliciou irony inthe offer in the courtlin of giving preference on such aghastly occasion ,Dracula,False
4290, my companion followed me quickly andcautiously drew the door to after carefully ascertainingthat the lock wa a falling and not a spring one ,Dracula,False
4291, in thelatter case we should have been in a bad plight ,Dracula,False
4292, then hefumbled in hi bag and taking out a matchbox and a piece ofcandle proceeded to make a light ,Dracula,False
4293, the tomb in the daytime and when wreathed with fresh flower had looked grim andgruesome enough but now some day afterward when theflower hung lank and dead their white turning to rust andtheir green to brown when the spider and the beetle hadresumed their accustomed dominance when the time discoloredstone and dust encrusted mortar and rusty dank iron andtarnished bras and clouded silver plating gave back thefeeble glimmer of a candle the effect wa more miserableand sordid than could have been imagined ,Dracula,False
4294, it conveyed irr esistibly the idea that life animal life wa not the onlything which could pas away ,Dracula,False
4295,  van helsing went about hi work systematically ,Dracula,False
4296, hold ing hi candle so that he could read the coffin plate andso holding it that the sperm dropped in white patche whichcongealed a they touched the metal he made assurance oflucy' coffin ,Dracula,False
4297, another search in hi bag and he took out aturnscrew ,Dracula,False
4298,  what are you going to do ,Dracula,False
4299,  to open the coffin ,Dracula,False
4300, you shall yet be convinced ,Dracula,False
4301,  straightway he began taking out the screw and finallylifted off the lid showing the casing of lead beneath ,Dracula,False
4302, thesight wa almost too much for me ,Dracula,False
4303, it seemed to be a much anaffront to the dead a it would have been to have strippedoff her clothing in her sleep whilst living ,Dracula,False
4304, i actually tookhold of hi hand to stop him ,Dracula,False
4305,  he only said you shall see and again fumbling in hisbag took out a tiny fret saw ,Dracula,False
4306, striking the turnscrew throughthe lead with a swift downward stab which made me wince hemade a small hole which wa however big enough to admitthe point of the saw ,Dracula,False
4307, i had expected a rush of ga from theweek old corpse ,Dracula,False
4308, we doctor who have had to study our dan ger have to become accustomed to such thing and i drewback toward the door ,Dracula,False
4309, but the professor never stopped fora moment ,Dracula,False
4310, he sawed down a couple of feet along one side ofthe lead coffin and then acros and down the other side ,Dracula,False
4311,taking the edge of the loose flange he bent it back towardsthe foot of the coffin and holding up the candle into theaperture motioned to me to look ,Dracula,False
4312,  i drew near and looked ,Dracula,False
4313, it wascertainly a surprise to me and gave me a considerable shock but van helsing wa unmoved ,Dracula,False
4314, he wa now more sure than everof hi ground and so emboldened to proceed in hi task ,Dracula,False
4315,  i felt all the dogged argumentativen of my natureawake within me a i answered him i am satisfied thatlucy' body i not in that coffin but that only prove onething ,Dracula,False
4316,  and what i that friend john ,Dracula,False
4317,  that it i not there ,Dracula,False
4318,  that i good logic he said so far a it goe ,Dracula,False
4319, buthow do you how can you account for it not being there ,Dracula,False
4320,  perhap a body snatcher i suggested ,Dracula,False
4321, some of theundertaker' people may have stolen it ,Dracula,False
4322, i felt that i wasspeaking folly and yet it wa the only real cause which icould suggest ,Dracula,False
4323, he said we must havemore proof ,Dracula,False
4324,  he put on the coffin lid again gathered up all histhing and placed them in the bag blew out the light andplaced the candle also in the bag ,Dracula,False
4325, we opened the door andwent out ,Dracula,False
4326, behind u he closed the door and locked it ,Dracula,False
4327, hehanded me the key saying will you keep it ,Dracula,False
4328,  i laughed it wa not a very cheerful laugh i am boundto say a i motioned him to keep it ,Dracula,False
4329, a key i nothing isaid thee are many duplicate and anyhow it i not diffi cult to pick a lock of thi kind ,Dracula,False
4330,  he said nothing but put the key in hi pocket ,Dracula,False
4331, thenhe told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst hewould watch at the other ,Dracula,False
4332, i took up my place behind a yew tree and i saw hisdark figure move until the intervening headstone and treeshid it from my sight ,Dracula,False
4333, it wa a lonely vigil ,Dracula,False
4334, just after i had taken my place iheard a distant clock strike twelve and in time came one andtwo ,Dracula,False
4335,i wa chilled and unnerved and angry with the professorfor taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming ,Dracula,False
4336,i wa too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant and notsleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether i had adreary miserable time ,Dracula,False
4337,  suddenly a i turned round i thought i saw somethinglike a white streak moving between two dark yew tree at theside of the churchyard farthest from the tomb ,Dracula,False
4338, at the sametime a dark mas moved from the professor' side of theground and hurriedly went toward it ,Dracula,False
4339, then i too moved buti had to go round headstone and railed off tomb and istumbled over grave ,Dracula,False
4340,the sky wa overcast and somewhere faroff an early cock crew ,Dracula,False
4341, a little way off beyond a line ofscattered juniper tree which marked the pathway to thechurch a white dim figure flitted in the direction of thetomb ,Dracula,False
4342, the tomb itself wa hidden by tree and i could notsee where the figure had disappeared ,Dracula,False
4343, i heard the rustle ofactual movement where i had first seen the white figure andcoming over found the professor holding in hi arm a tinychild ,Dracula,False
4344, when he saw me he held it out to me and said areyou satisfied now ,Dracula,False
4345,  no i said in a way that i felt wa aggressive ,Dracula,False
4346,  do you not see the child ,Dracula,False
4347,  ye it i a child but who brought it here ,Dracula,False
4348,  we shall see said the professor and with one impulsewe took our way out of the churchyard he carrying the sleep ing child ,Dracula,False
4349,  when we had got some little distance away we went intoa clump of tree and struck a match and looked at thechild' throat ,Dracula,False
4350, it wa without a scratch or scar of any kind ,Dracula,False
4351,  we were just in time said the professor thankfully ,Dracula,False
4352,  we had now to decide what we were to do with the child and so consulted about it ,Dracula,False
4353, if we were to take it to a policestation we should have to give some account of our movementsduring the night ,Dracula,False
4354, at least we should have had to make somestatement a to how we had come to find the child ,Dracula,False
4355,so finallywe decided that we would take it to the heath and when weheard a policeman coming would leave it where he could notfail to find it ,Dracula,False
4356, we would then seek our way home a quicklya we could ,Dracula,False
4357, at the edge of hampsteadheath we heard a policeman' heavy tramp and laying thechild on the pathway we waited and watched until he saw ita he flashed hi lantern to and fro ,Dracula,False
4358, we heard hi exclam ation of astonishment and then we went away silently ,Dracula,False
4359, bygood chance we got a cab near the `spainiard ' and drove totown ,Dracula,False
4360,  i cannot sleep so i make thi entry ,Dracula,False
4361, but i must try toget a few hours' sleep a van helsing i to call for me atnoon ,Dracula,False
4362, he insist that i go with him on another expedition ,Dracula,False
4363, it wa two o'clock before we found asuitable opportunity for our attempt ,Dracula,False
4364, the funeral held atnoon wa all completed and the last straggler of the mour ner had taken themselve lazily away when looking care fully from behind a clump of alder tree we saw the sextonlock the gate after him ,Dracula,False
4365, we knew that we were safe tillmorning did we desire it but the professor told me that weshould not want more than an hour at most ,Dracula,False
4366, again i felt thathorrid sense of the reality of thing in which any effort ofimagination seemed out of place and i realized distinctlythe peril of the law which we were incurring in our unhal lowed work ,Dracula,False
4367, beside i felt it wa all so usel ,Dracula,False
4368, outrag eou a it wa to open a leaden coffin to see if a womandead nearly a week were really dead it now seemed the heightof folly to open the tomb again when we knew from the evi dence of our own eyesight that the coffin wa empty ,Dracula,False
4369, ishrugged my shoulder however and rested silent for vanhelsing had a way of going on hi own road no matter whoremonstrated ,Dracula,False
4370, he took the key opened the vault and againcourteously motioned me to precede ,Dracula,False
4371, the place wa not sogruesome a last night but oh how unutterably mean lookingwhen the sunshine streamed in ,Dracula,False
4372, van helsing walked over tolucy' coffin and i followed ,Dracula,False
4373, he bent over and again forcedback the leaden flange and a shock of surprise and dismayshot through me ,Dracula,False
4374,  there lay lucy seemingly just a we had seen her thenight before her funeral ,Dracula,False
4375, she wa if possible more radi antly beautiful than ever and i could not believe that shewa dead ,Dracula,False
4376, the lip were red nay redder than before andon the cheek wa a delicate bloom ,Dracula,False
4377,  i thi a juggle ,Dracula,False
4378,  are you convinced now ,Dracula,False
4379, said the professor in response and a he spoke he put over hi hand and in a way that mademe shudder pulled back the dead lip and showed the whiteteeth ,Dracula,False
4380, see he went on they are even sharper than before ,Dracula,False
4381,with thi and thi and he touched one of the canine teethand that below it the little children can be bitten ,Dracula,False
4382, areyou of belief now friend john ,Dracula,False
4383,  once more argumentative hostility woke within me ,Dracula,False
4384, icould not accept such an overwhelming idea a he suggested ,Dracula,False
4385,so with an attempt to argue of which i wa even at the mom ent ashamed i said she may have been placed here sincelast night ,Dracula,False
4386, that i so and by whom ,Dracula,False
4387,  i do not know ,Dracula,False
4388,  and yet she ha been dead one week ,Dracula,False
4389, most people inthat time would not look so ,Dracula,False
4390,  i had no answer for thi so wa silent ,Dracula,False
4391, van helsingdid not seem to notice my silence ,Dracula,False
4392, at any rate he showedneither chagrin nor triumph ,Dracula,False
4393, he wa looking intently at theface of the dead woman raising the eyelid and looking atthe eye and once more opening the lip and examining theteeth ,Dracula,False
4394, then he turned to me and said here there i one thing which i different from allrecorded ,Dracula,False
4395, here i some dual life that i not a the common ,Dracula,False
4396,she wa bitten by the vampire when she wa in a trance sleep walking oh you start ,Dracula,False
4397, you do not know that friendjohn but you shall know it later and in trance could hebest come to take more blood ,Dracula,False
4398, in trance she die and intrance she i un dead too ,Dracula,False
4399, so it i that she differ fromall other ,Dracula,False
4400, usually when the un dead sleep at home a hespoke he made a comprehensive sweep of hi arm to designatewhat to a vampire wa `home' their face show what they are but thi so sweet that wa when she not un dead she go backto the nothing of the common dead ,Dracula,False
4401, there i no malign there see and so it make hard that i must kill her in her sleep ,Dracula,False
4402,  thi turned my blood cold and it began to dawn upon methat i wa accepting van helsing' theorie ,Dracula,False
4403, but if she werereally dead what wa there of terror in the idea of killingher ,Dracula,False
4404,  he looked up at me and evidently saw the change in myface for he said almost joyously ah you believe now ,Dracula,False
4405,  i answered do not pr me too hard all at once ,Dracula,False
4406, how will you do thi bloody work ,Dracula,False
4407,  i shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with gar lic and i shall drive a stake through her body ,Dracula,False
4408,  it made me shudder to think of so mutilating the bodyof the woman whom i had loved ,Dracula,False
4409, and yet the feeling wa notso strong a i had expected ,Dracula,False
4410, i wa in fact beginning toshudder at the presence of thi being thi un dead a vanhelsing called it and to loathe it ,Dracula,False
4411, i it possible thatlove i all subjective or all objective ,Dracula,False
4412,  i waited a considerable time for van helsing to begin but he stood a if wrapped in thought ,Dracula,False
4413, presently he closedthe catch of hi bag with a snap and said i have been thinking and have made up my mind a towhat i best ,Dracula,False
4414, if i did simply follow my inclining i woulddo now at thi moment what i to be done ,Dracula,False
4415, but there areother thing to follow and thing that are thousand timesmore difficult in that them we do not know ,Dracula,False
4416,she have yet no life taken though that i of time and toact now would be to take danger from her forever ,Dracula,False
4417, but thenwe may have to want arthur and how shall we tell him ofthis ,Dracula,False

5366,  we found him in a state of considerable excitement butfar more rational in hi speech and manner than i had everseen him ,Dracula,False
5367, there wa an unusual understanding of himself which wa unlike anything i had ever met with in a lunatic and he took it for granted that hi reason would prevailwith other entirely sane ,Dracula,False

5369, hi requestwa that i would at once release him from the asylum andsend him home ,Dracula,False

5371,  i appeal to your friend he said they will perhap not mind sitting in judgement on my case ,Dracula,False
5372, by the way youhave not introduced me ,Dracula,False
5373,  i wa so much astonished that the oddn of introduc ing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment and beside there wa a certain dignity in the man' manner so much of the habit of equality that i at once made theintroduction lord godalming professor van helsing mrquincey morri of texa mr jonathan harker mr renfield ,Dracula,False

5385,he made thi last appeal witha courtly air of conviction which wa not without it owncharm ,Dracula,False
5386,  i think we were all staggered ,Dracula,False
5387, for my own part i wasunder the conviction despite my knowledge of the man'scharacter and history that hi reason had been restored andi felt under a strong impulse to tell him that i wa satis fied a to hi sanity and would see about the necessaryformalitie for hi release in the morning ,Dracula,False
5388, i thought itbetter to wait however before making so grave a statement for of old i knew the sudden change to which thi parti cular patient wa liable ,Dracula,False
5389, so i contented myself with makinga general statement that he appeared to be improving veryrapidly that i would have a longer chat with him in themorning and would then see what i could do in the directionof meeting hi wishe ,Dracula,False
5390,  thi did not at all satisfy him for he said quickly but i fear dr ,Dracula,False

5405,  again he looked at u all keenly ,Dracula,False
5406, i had a growing con viction that thi sudden change of hi entire intellectualmethod wa but yet another phase of hi madn and sodetermined to let him go on a little longer knowing fromexperience that he would like all lunatic give himselfaway in the end ,Dracula,False
5407, van helsing wa gazing at him with a lookof utmost intensity hi bushy eyebrow almost meeting withthe fixed concentration of hi look ,Dracula,False
5408, he said to renfield ina tone which did not surprise me at the time but only wheni thought of it afterward for it wa a of one addressingan equal can you not tell frankly your real reason forwishing to be free tonight ,Dracula,False
5409, i will undertake that if youwill satisfy even me a stranger without prejudice andwith the habit of keeping an open mind dr ,Dracula,False
5410, seward will giveyou at hi own risk and on hi own responsibility theprivilege you seek ,Dracula,False
5411,  he shook hi head sadly and with a look of poignantregret on hi face ,Dracula,False
5412, the professor went on come sir bethink yourself ,Dracula,False

5422,  i thought it wa now time to end the scene which wasbecoming too comically grave so i went toward the door simply saying come my friend we have work to do ,Dracula,False
5423,  a however i got near the door a new change cameover the patient ,Dracula,False
5424, he moved toward me so quickly that forthe moment i feared that he wa about to make another homi cidal attack ,Dracula,False
5425, my fear however were groundl for heheld up hi two hand imploringly and made hi petition ina moving manner ,Dracula,False
5426, a he saw that the very exc of hisemotion wa militating against him by restoring u moreto our old relation he became still more demonstrative ,Dracula,False

5460, all isbest a they are ,Dracula,False
5461, seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kindof way i don't know but that i agree with you ,Dracula,False
5462, if thatman had been an ordinary lunatic i would have taken mychance of trusting him but he seem so mixed up with thecount in an indexy kind of way that i am afraid of doing any thing wrong by helping hi fad ,Dracula,False
5463,i can't forget how he prayedwith almost equal fervor for a cat and then tried to tear mythroat out with hi teeth ,Dracula,False
5464,beside he called the count `lordand master' and he may want to get out to help him in somediabolical way ,Dracula,False
5465,that horrid thing ha the wolve and the ratsand hi own kind to help him so i suppose he isn't abovetrying to use a respectable lunatic ,Dracula,False

5473, he held up a little silver whistle a heremarked that old place may be full of rat and if so i've got an antidote on call ,Dracula,False
5474,  having passed the wall we took our way to the house taking care to keep in the shadow of the tree on the lawnwhen the moonlight shone out ,Dracula,False
5475, when we got to the porch theprofessor opened hi bag and took out a lot of thing whichhe laid on the step sorting them into four little group evidently one for each ,Dracula,False
5476,  my friend we are going into a terrible danger and weneed arm of many kind ,Dracula,False

5478,remember that he ha the strength of twenty men and that though our neck or our windpipe are of the common kind andtherefore breakable or crushable hi are not amenable tomere strength ,Dracula,False
5479, a stronger man or a body of men more strongin all than him can at certain time hold him but they can not hurt him a we can be hurt by him ,Dracula,False
5480, we must therefore guard ourselve from hi touch ,Dracula,False

5488, pre sently he got one to suit after a little play back andforward the bolt yielded and with a rusty clang shot back ,Dracula,False
5489,we pressed on the door the rusty hinge creaked and itslowly opened ,Dracula,False
5490, it wa startlingly like the image conveyed tome in dr ,Dracula,False
5491, seward' diary of the opening of mis westenra'stomb i fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the other for with one accord they shrank back ,Dracula,False
5492, the professor wa thefirst to move forward and stepped into the open door ,Dracula,False
5493,  in manu tua domine ,Dracula,False
5494,he said crossing himself a hepassed over the threshold ,Dracula,False
5495,we closed the door behind u lestwhen we should have lit our lamp we should possibly attractattention from the road ,Dracula,False
5496, the professor carefully tried thelock lest we might not be able to open it from withinshould we be in a hurry making our exit ,Dracula,False
5497, then we all lit ourlamp and proceeded on our search ,Dracula,False
5498,  the light from the tiny lamp fell in all sort of oddform a the ray crossed each other or the opacity of ourbodie threw great shadow ,Dracula,False
5499, i could not for my life get awayfrom the feeling that there wa someone else amongst u ,Dracula,False
5500, isuppose it wa the recollection so powerfully brought hometo me by the grim surrounding of that terrible experiencein transylvania ,Dracula,False
5501, i think the feeling wa common to u all for i noticed that the other kept looking over theirshoulder at every sound and every new shadow just a i feltmyself doing ,Dracula,False
5502,  the whole place wa thick with dust ,Dracula,False
5503,the floor wa seem ingly inche deep except where there were recent footstep in which on holding down my lamp i could see mark of hob nail where the dust wa cracked ,Dracula,False
5504, the wall were fluffy andheavy with dust and in the corner were masse of spider'sweb whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like oldtattered rag a the weight had torn them partly down ,Dracula,False
5505, on atable in the hall wa a great bunch of key with a time yellowed label on each ,Dracula,False
5506,they had been used several time foron the table were several similar rent in the blanket ofdust similar to that exposed when the professor lifted them ,Dracula,False
5507,  he turned to me and said you know thi place jonathan ,Dracula,False
5508,you have copied map of it and you know it at least morethan we do ,Dracula,False
5509, which i the way to the chapel ,Dracula,False
5510,  i had an idea of it direction though on my formervisit i had not been able to get admission to it so i ledthe way and after a few wrong turning found myself oppositea low arched oaken door ribbed with iron band ,Dracula,False
5511,  thi i the spot said the professor a he turned hislamp on a small map of the house copied from the file of myoriginal correspondence regarding the purchase ,Dracula,False
5512, with alittle trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened thedoor ,Dracula,False
5513, we were prepared for some unpleasantn for a wewere opening the door a faint malodorou air seemed to ex hale through the gap but none of u ever expected such anodor a we encountered ,Dracula,False
5514, none of the other had met thecount at all at close quarter and when i had seen him hewa either in the fasting stage of hi existence in hisroom or when he wa bloated with fresh blood in a ruinedbuilding open to the air but here the place wa small andclose and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul ,Dracula,False
5515,there wa an earthy smell a of some dry miasma which camethrough the fouler air ,Dracula,False
5516, but a to the odor itself how shalli describe it ,Dracula,False
5517, it wa not alone that it wa composed of allthe ill of mortality and with the pungent acrid smell ofblood but it seemed a though corruption had become itselfcorrupt ,Dracula,False
5518, it sicken me to think of it ,Dracula,False
5519, every breathexhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the placeand intensified it loathsomen ,Dracula,False
5520,  under ordinary circumstance such a stench would havebrought our enterprise to an end but thi wa no ordinarycase and the high and terrible purpose in which we were in volved gave u a strength which rose above merely physicalconsideration ,Dracula,False
5521, after the involuntary shrinking consequenton the first nauseou whiff we one and all set about ourwork a though that loathsome place were a garden of rose ,Dracula,False
5522,  we made an accurate examination of the place the pro fessor saying a we began the first thing i to see howmany of the boxe are left we must then examine every holeand corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue asto what ha become of the rest ,Dracula,False
5523,  a glance wa sufficient to show how many remained forthe great earth chest were bulky and there wa no mistakingthem ,Dracula,False
5524,  there were only twenty nine left out of the fifty ,Dracula,False
5525, oncei got a fright for seeing lord godalming suddenly turn andlook out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond ilooked too and for an instant my heart stood still ,Dracula,False
5526, some where looking out from the shadow i seemed to see the highlight of the count' evil face the ridge of the nose thered eye the red lip the awful pallor ,Dracula,False
5527, it wa only for amoment for a lord godalming said i thought i saw a face but it wa only the shadow and resumed hi inquiry iturned my lamp in the direction and stepped into the passage ,Dracula,False
5528,there wa no sign of anyone and a there were no corner nodoor no aperture of any kind but only the solid wall ofthe passage there could be no hiding place even for him ,Dracula,False
5529, itook it that fear had helped imagination and said nothing ,Dracula,False
5530,  a few minute later i saw morri step suddenly backfrom a corner which he wa examining ,Dracula,False
5531, we all followed hismovement with our eye for undoubtedly some nervousn wasgrowing on u and we saw a whole mas of phosphorescence which twinkled like star ,Dracula,False
5532, we all instinctively drew back ,Dracula,False
5533,the whole place wa becoming alive with rat ,Dracula,False
5534,  for a moment or two we stood appalled all save lordgodalming who wa seemingly prepared for such an emergency ,Dracula,False
5535,rushing over to the great iron bound oaken door which dr ,Dracula,False
5536,seward had described from the outside and which i had seenmyself he turned the key in the lock drew the huge bolt and swung the door open ,Dracula,False
5537, then taking hi little silverwhistle from hi pocket he blew a low shrill call ,Dracula,False
5538, it wasanswered from behind dr ,Dracula,False
5539, seward' house by the yelping ofdog and after about a minute three terrier came dashinground the corner of the house ,Dracula,False
5540, unconsciously we had allmoved toward the door and a we moved i noticed that thedust had been much disturbed ,Dracula,False
5541, the boxe which had been takenout had been brought thi way ,Dracula,False
5542, but even in the minute thathad elapsed the number of the rat had vastly increased ,Dracula,False
5543,theyseemed to swarm over the place all at once till the lamp light shining on their moving dark bodie and glittering baleful eye made the place look like a bank of earth setwith fireflie ,Dracula,False
5544, the dog dashed on but at the thresholdsuddenly stopped and snarled and then simultaneously liftingtheir nose began to howl in most lugubriou fashion ,Dracula,False
5545, therat were multiplying in thousand and we moved out ,Dracula,False
5546,  lord godalming lifted one of the dog and carrying himin placed him on the floor ,Dracula,False
5547,the instant hi feet touched theground he seemed to recover hi courage and rushed at hisnatural enemie ,Dracula,False
5548, they fled before him so fast that before hehad shaken the life out of a score the other dog who hadby now been lifted in the same manner had but small preyere the whole mas had vanished ,Dracula,False
5549,  with their going it seemed a if some evil presence haddeparted for the dog frisked about and barked merrily asthey made sudden dart at their prostrate foe and turnedthem over and over and tossed them in the air with viciousshake ,Dracula,False
5550, we all seemed to find our spirit rise ,Dracula,False
5551, whether itwa the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening ofthe chapel door or the relief which we experienced byfinding ourselve in the open i know not but most certainlythe shadow of dread seemed to slip from u like a robe andthe occasion of our coming lost something of it grim signi ficance though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution ,Dracula,False
5552,we closed the outer door and barred and locked it and bring ing the dog with u began our search of the house ,Dracula,False
5553, wefound nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary pro portion and all untouched save for my own footstep when ihad made my first visit ,Dracula,False
5554, never once did the dog exhibitany symptom of uneasin and even when we returned to thechapel they frisked about a though they had been rabbithunting in a summer wood ,Dracula,False
5555,  the morning wa quickening in the east when we emergedfrom the front ,Dracula,False
5556, van helsing had taken the key of thehall door from the bunch and locked the door in orthodoxfashion putting the key into hi pocket when he had done ,Dracula,False
5557,  so far he said our night ha been eminently suc cessful ,Dracula,False
5558, no harm ha come to u such a i feared might beand yet we have ascertained how many boxe are missing ,Dracula,False
5559, morethan all do i rejoice that thi our first and perhap ourmost difficult and dangerou step ha been accomplishedwithout the bringing thereinto our most sweet madam mina ortroubling her waking or sleeping thought with sight andsound and smell of horror which she might never forget ,Dracula,False

5561,wehave other matter before u other danger other fear andthat monster ,Dracula,False
5562, he ha not used hi power over the bruteworld for the only or the last time tonight ,Dracula,False
5563, so be it thathe ha gone elsewhere ,Dracula,False
5564, it ha given u opportunity tocry `check'in some way in thi ch game which we play forthe stake of human soul ,Dracula,False
5565, and now let u go home ,Dracula,False
5566, the dawni close at hand and we have reason to be content with ourfirst night' work ,Dracula,False
5567, it may be ordained that we have manynight and day to follow if full of peril but we must goon and from no danger shall we shrink ,Dracula,False
5568,  the house wa silent when we got back save for somepoor creature who wa screaming away in one of the distantward and a low moaning sound from renfield' room ,Dracula,False
5569, thepoor wretch wa doubtl torturing himself after the mannerof the insane with needl thought of pain ,Dracula,False
5570,  i came tiptoe into our own room and found mina asleep breathing so softly that i had to put my ear down to hearit ,Dracula,False

5635, he spoke to me before he went out nevermore sweetly or tenderly but he never mentioned a word ofwhat had happened in the visit to the count' house ,Dracula,False

5644, then if he ha feared of my trusti shall show it to him with every thought of my heart putdown for hi dear eye to read ,Dracula,False
5645, i feel strangely sad andlow spirited today ,Dracula,False
5646, i suppose it i the reaction from theterrible excitement ,Dracula,False
5647,  last night i went to bed when the men had gone simplybecause they told me to ,Dracula,False
5648, i didn't feel sleepy and i didfeel full of devouring anxiety ,Dracula,False
5649, i kept thinking over every thing that ha been ever since jonathan came to see me inlondon and it all seem like a horrible tragedy with fatepressing on relentlessly to some destined end ,Dracula,False

5660,  i can't quite remember how i fell asleep last night ,Dracula,False
5661, iremember hearing the sudden barking of the dog and a lot ofqueer sound like praying on a very tumultuou scale frommr renfield' room which i somewhere under thi ,Dracula,False

5663,allwa dark and silent the black shadow thrown by the moon light seeming full of a silent mystery of their own ,Dracula,False
5664, not athing seemed to be stirring but all to be grim and fixed asdeath or fate so that a thin streak of white mist that creptwith almost imperceptible slown acros the gras towardsthe house seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of itsown ,Dracula,False
5665, i think that the digression of my thought must havedone me good for when i got back to bed i found a lethargycreeping over me ,Dracula,False
5666, i lay a while but could not quite sleep so i got out and looked out of the window again ,Dracula,False
5667, the mistwa spreading and wa now close up to the house so that icould see it lying thick against the wall a though it werestealing up to the window ,Dracula,False
5668, the poor man wa more loud thanever and though i could not distinguish a word he said icould in some way recognize in hi tone some passionate en treaty on hi part ,Dracula,False
5669, then there wa the sound of a struggle and i knew that the attendant were dealing with him ,Dracula,False
5670, i wasso frightened that i crept into bed and pulled the clothesover my head putting my finger in my ear ,Dracula,False

6569, that the two doctor and ishould remain there whilst lord godalming and quincey foundthe lair at walworth and mile end and destroyed them ,Dracula,False

8022,  (b) how i he to be taken ,Dracula,False
8023, here a proc of exclu sion may help u ,Dracula,False
8024, by road by rail by water ,Dracula,False
8025, there are endl difficultie especi ally in leaving the city ,Dracula,False
8026,  (x) there are people ,Dracula,False
8027, and people are curiou andinvestigate ,Dracula,False
8028, a hint a surmise a doubt a to what might bein the box would destroy him ,Dracula,False
8029,  (y) there are or there may be custom and octroiofficer to pas ,Dracula,False
8030,  (z) hi pursuer might follow ,Dracula,False
8031, and in order to prevent hi being betrayed he hasrepelled so far a he can even hi victim me ,Dracula,False
8032, there i no one in charge of the box ,Dracula,False
8033, itwould have to take it chance of being delayed and delaywould be fatal with enemie on the track ,Dracula,False
8034, true he mightescape at night ,Dracula,False
8035, but what would he be if left in a strangeplace with no refuge that he could fly to ,Dracula,False
8036, thi i not whathe intend and he doe not mean to risk it ,Dracula,False
8037, here i the safest way in one respect but with most danger in another ,Dracula,False
8038, on the water he i power l except at night ,Dracula,False
8039, even then he can only summon fog andstorm and snow and hi wolve ,Dracula,False
8040, but were he wrecked theliving water would engulf him helpl and he would indeedbe lost ,Dracula,False
8041, he could have the vessel drive to land but if itwere unfriendly land wherein he wa not free to move hisposition would still be desperate ,Dracula,False
8042,  we know from the record that he wa on the water sowhat we have to do i to ascertain what water ,Dracula,False
8043,  the first thing i to realize exactly what he ha donea yet ,Dracula,False
8044, we may then get a light on what hi task i to be ,Dracula,False
8045, we must differentiate between what he did inlondon a part of hi general plan of action when he waspressed for moment and had to arrange a best he could ,Dracula,False
8046,  secondly we must see a well a we can surmise it fromthe fact we know of what he ha done here ,Dracula,False
8047,  a to the first he evidently intended to arrive atgalatz and sent invoice to varna to deceive u lest weshould ascertain hi mean of exit from england ,Dracula,False
8048, hi immed iate and sole purpose then wa to escape ,Dracula,False
8049, the proof of thi i the letter of instruction sent ot immanuel hildesheim toclear and take away the box before sunrise ,Dracula,False
8050,there i also theinstruction to petrof skinsky ,Dracula,False
8051, these we must only gu at but there must have been some letter or message since skin sky came to hildesheim ,Dracula,False
8052,  that so far hi plan were successful we know ,Dracula,False
8053, theczarina catherine made a phenomenally quick journey ,Dracula,False
8054, so muchso that captain donelson' suspicion were aroused ,Dracula,False
8055, but hissuperstition united with hi cannin played the count'sgame for him and he ran with hi favoring wind through fogsand all till he brought up blindfold at galatz ,Dracula,False
8056, that thecount' arrangement were well made ha been proved ,Dracula,False
8057,hilde sheim cleared the box took it off and gave it to skinsky ,Dracula,False
8058,skinsky took it and here we lose the trail ,Dracula,False
8059, we only knowthat the box i somewhere on the water moving along ,Dracula,False
8060, thecustom and the octroi if there be any have been avoided ,Dracula,False
8061,  now we come to what the count must have done after hisarrival on land at galatz ,Dracula,False
8062,  the box wa given to skinsky before sunrise ,Dracula,False
8063, at sun rise the count could appear in hi own form ,Dracula,False
8064, here we askwhy skinsky wa chosen at all to aid in the work ,Dracula,False
8065, in myhusband' diary skinsky i mentioned a dealing with theslovak who trade down the river to the port ,Dracula,False
8066, and the man'sremark that the murder wa the work of a slovak showed thegeneral feeling against hi clas ,Dracula,False
8067, the count wanted iso lation ,Dracula,False
8068,  my surmise i thi that in london the count decidedto get back to hi castle by water a the most safe andsecret way ,Dracula,False
8069, he wa brought from the castle by szgany andprobably they delivered their cargo to slovak who took theboxe to varna for there they were shipped to london ,Dracula,False
8070, thusthe count had knowledge of the person who could arrangethi service ,Dracula,False
8071, when the box wa on land before sunrise orafter sunset he came out from hi box met skinsky andinstructed him what to do a to arranging the carriage ofthe box up some river ,Dracula,False
8072, when thi wa done and he knew thatall wa in train he blotted out hi trace a he thought by murdering hi agent ,Dracula,False
8073,  i have examined the map and find that the river mostsuitable for the slovak to have ascended i either thepruth or the sereth ,Dracula,False
8074, i read in the typescript that in mytrance i heard cow low and water swirling level with myear and the creaking of wood ,Dracula,False
8075, the count in hi box then wa on a river in an open boat propelled probably eitherby oar or pole for the bank are near and it i workingagainst stream ,Dracula,False
8076, there would be no such if floating downstream ,Dracula,False
8077,  of course it may not be either the sereth or the pruth but we may possibly investigate further ,Dracula,False
8078, now of these two the pruth i the more easily navigated but the sereth i at fundu joined by the bistritza which run up round theborgo pas ,Dracula,False
8079, the loop it make i manifestly a close todracula' castle a can be got by water ,Dracula,False
8080,  mina harker' journal continued  when i had done reading jonathan took me in hi armsand kissed me ,Dracula,False
8081, the other kept shaking me by both hand and dr ,Dracula,False
8082, van helsing said our dear madam mina i once moreour teacher ,Dracula,False
8083, her eye have been where we were blinded ,Dracula,False
8084, nowwe are on the track once again and thi time we may succeed ,Dracula,False
8085,our enemy i at hi most helpl ,Dracula,False
8086, and if we can come on himby day on the water our task will be over ,Dracula,False
8087, he ha a start but he i powerl to hasten a he may not leave thi boxlest those who carry him may suspect ,Dracula,False
8088, for them to suspectwould be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where heperish ,Dracula,False
8089, thi he know and will not ,Dracula,False
8090, now men to our councilof war for here and now we must plan what each and allshall do ,Dracula,False
8091,  i shall get a steam launch and follow him said lordgodalming ,Dracula,False
8092,  and i horse to follow on the bank lest by chance heland said mr morri ,Dracula,False
8093, said the professor both good ,Dracula,False
8094, there must be force to overcome force ifneed be ,Dracula,False
8095, the slovak i strong and rough and he carriesrude arms all the men smiled for amongst them theycarried a small arsenal ,Dracula,False
8096,  said mr morri i have brought some winchester ,Dracula,False
8097,they are pretty handy in a crowd and there may be wolve ,Dracula,False
8098,the count if you remember took some other precaution ,Dracula,False
8099, hemade some requisition on other that mr ,Dracula,False
8100, harker could notquite hear or understand ,Dracula,False
8101, we must be ready at all point ,Dracula,False
8102, seward said i think i had better go with quincey ,Dracula,False
8103,we have been accustomed to hunt together and we two wellarmed will be a match for whatever may come along ,Dracula,False
8104, you mustnot be alone art ,Dracula,False
8105, it may be necessary to fight the slovak and a chance thrust for i don't suppose these fellow carrygun would undo all our plan ,Dracula,False
8106,there must be no chance thistime ,Dracula,False
8107, we shall not rest until the count' head and bodyhave been separated and we are sure that he cannot rein carnate ,Dracula,False
8108,  he looked at jonathan a he spoke and jonathan lookedat me ,Dracula,False
8109, i could see that the poor dear wa torn about in hismind ,Dracula,False
8110, of course he wanted to be with me ,Dracula,False
8111, but then the boatservice would most likely be the one which would destroythe ,Dracula,False
8112, (why did i hesitate towrite the word ,Dracula,False
8113,)  he wa silent awhile and during hi silence dr ,Dracula,False
8114, vanhelsing spoke friend jonathan thi i to you for twicereason ,Dracula,False
8115, first because you are young and brave and canfight and all energie may be needed at the last ,Dracula,False
8116, and againthat it i your right to destroy him ,Dracula,False
8117,that which ha wroughtsuch woe to you and your ,Dracula,False
8118, be not afraid for madam mina ,Dracula,False
8119, shewill be my care if i may ,Dracula,False
8120, my leg are not soquick to run a once ,Dracula,False
8121, and i am not used to ride so long orto pursue a need be or to fight with lethal weapon ,Dracula,False
8122, buti can be of other service ,Dracula,False
8123, i can fight in other way ,Dracula,False
8124, and ican die if need be a well a younger men ,Dracula,False
8125, now let me saythat what i would i thi ,Dracula,False
8126, while you my lord godalming andfriend jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up theriver and whilst john and quincey guard the bank where per chance he might be landed i will take madam mina right intothe heart of the enemy' country ,Dracula,False

8554, and the poor soul i can pity them now andweep a i think of them placid each in her full sleep ofdeath for a short moment ere fading ,Dracula,False
8555, for friend john hardlyhad my knife severed the head of each before the whole bodybegan to melt away and crumble into it native dust asthough the death that should have come centurie agone hadat last assert himself and say at once and loud i am here ,Dracula,False
8556,  before i left the castle i so fixed it entrance thatnever more can the count enter there undead ,Dracula,False

8566, we did not go fast though the way wassteeply downhill for w e had to take heavy rug and wrapswith u ,Dracula,False
8567, we dared not face the possibility of being leftwithout warmth in the cold and the snow ,Dracula,False
8568, we had to take someof our provision too for we were in a perfect desolation and so far a we could see through the snowfall there wasnot even the sign of habitation ,Dracula,False
8569, when we had gone about amile i wa tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest ,Dracula,False
8570,then we looked back and saw where the clear line of drac ula' castle cut the sky ,Dracula,False
8571, for we were so deep under the hillwhereon it wa set that the angle of perspective of the car pathian mountain wa far below it ,Dracula,False
8572, we saw it in all itsgrandeur perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheerprecipice and with seemingly a great gap between it and thesteep of the adjacent mountain on any side ,Dracula,False
8573, there wa some thing wild and uncanny about the place ,Dracula,False
8574, we could hear thedistant howling of wolve ,Dracula,False

8585,  he brought in our fur and made a snug nest for me andgot out some provision and forced them upon me ,Dracula,False
8586, but i couldnot eat to even try to do so wa repulsive to me and mucha i would have liked to please him i could not bring myselfto the attempt ,Dracula,False
8587, he looked very sad but did not reproach me ,Dracula,False
8588,taking hi field glasse from the case he stood on the topof the rock and began to search the horizon ,Dracula,False
8589,  suddenly he called out look ,Dracula,False
8590,  i sprang up and stood beside him on the rock ,Dracula,False
8591, he handedme hi glasse and pointed ,Dracula,False

8594, from the height where we were it wa possible to seea great distance ,Dracula,False
8595, and far off beyond the white waste ofsnow i could see the river lying like a black ribbon inkink and curl a it wound it way ,Dracula,False
8596, straight in front of usand not far off in fact so near that i wondered we had notnoticed before came a group of mounted men hurrying along ,Dracula,False
8597,in the midst of them wa a cart a long leiter wagon whichswept from side to side like a dog' tail wagging with eachstern inequality of the road ,Dracula,False
8598, outlined against the snow asthey were i could see from the men' clothe that they werepeasant or gypsie of some kind ,Dracula,False
8599,  on the cart wa a great square chest ,Dracula,False
8600, my heart leapeda i saw it for i felt that the end wa coming ,Dracula,False
8601, the eveningwa now drawing close and well i knew that at sunset thething which wa till then imprisoned there would take newfreedom and could in any of many form elude pursuit ,Dracula,False
8602,in feari turned to the professor ,Dracula,False
8603, to my consternation however hewa not there ,Dracula,False
8604, an instant later i saw him below me ,Dracula,False
8605, roundthe rock he had drawn a circle such a we had found shelterin last night ,Dracula,False
8606,  when he had completed it he stood beside me again say ing at least you shall be safe here from him ,Dracula,False
8607, he took theglasse from me and at the next lull of the snow swept thewhole space below u ,Dracula,False
8608, see he said they come quickly ,Dracula,False
8609, theyare flogging the horse and galloping a hard a they can ,Dracula,False
8610,  he paused and went on in a hollow voice they are rac ing for the sunset ,Dracula,False
8611, we may be too late ,Dracula,False
8612,down came another blinding rush of driving snow and thewhole landscape wa blotted out ,Dracula,False
8613, it soon passed however and once more hi glasse were fixed on the plain ,Dracula,False
8614,  then came a sudden cry look ,Dracula,False

8621, at the same time i knew that jonathan wasnot far off ,Dracula,False
8622, looking around i saw on the north side of thecoming party two other men riding at breakneck speed ,Dracula,False
8623, oneof them i knew wa jonathan and the other i took of course to be lord godalming ,Dracula,False
8624, they too were pursuing the party withthe cart ,Dracula,False
8625, when i told the professor he shouted in glee likea schoolboy and after looking intently till a snow fallmade sight impossible he laid hi winchester rifle ready foruse against the boulder at the opening of our shelter ,Dracula,False
8626,  they are all converging he said ,Dracula,False
8627,when the time comeswe shall have gypsie on all side ,Dracula,False
8628, i got out my revolverready to hand for whilst we were speaking the howling ofwolve came louder and closer ,Dracula,False
8629, when the snow storm abated amoment we looked again ,Dracula,False
8630, it wa strange to see the snow fall ing in such heavy flake close to u and beyond the sunshining more and more brightly a it sank down toward thefar mountain top ,Dracula,False
8631, sweeping the glas all around u i couldsee here and there dot moving singly and in two and threesand larger number ,Dracula,False
8632,the wolve were gathering for their prey ,Dracula,False
8633,  every instant seemed an age whilst we waited ,Dracula,False
8634, the windcame now in fierce burst and the snow wa driven with furya it swept upon u in circling eddie ,Dracula,False
8635, at time we couldnot see an arm' length before u ,Dracula,False
8636, but at other a thehollow sounding wind swept by u it seemed to clear the airspace around u so that we could see afar off ,Dracula,False
8637, we had oflate been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset thatwe knew with fair accuracy when it would be ,Dracula,False
8638,and we knew thatbefore long the sun would set ,Dracula,False
8639, it wa hard to believe thatby our watche it wa l than an hour that we waited inthat rocky shelter before the variou bodie began to con verge close upon u ,Dracula,False
8640, the wind came now with fiercer and morebitter sweep and more steadily from the north ,Dracula,False
8641,it seeminglyhad driven the snow cloud from u for with only occasionalburst the snow fell ,Dracula,False
8642, we could distinguish clearly theindividual of each party the pursued and the pursuer ,Dracula,False
8643,strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realize orat least to care that they were pursued ,Dracula,False
8644, they seemed how ever to hasten with redoubled speed a the sun dropped lowerand lower on the mountain top ,Dracula,False
8645,  closer and closer they drew ,Dracula,False
8646, the professor and i crouc hed down behind our rock and held our weapon ready ,Dracula,False
8647, icould see that he wa determined that they should not pas ,Dracula,False
8648,one and all were quite unaware of our presence ,Dracula,False

8650, one wasmy jonathan' raised in a high key of passion ,Dracula,False
8651, the other mrmorris' strong resolute tone of quiet command ,Dracula,False
8652, the gypsiesmay not have known the language but there wa no mistakingthe tone in whatever tongue the word were spoken ,Dracula,False

8654, seward and mr morrison the other ,Dracula,False
8655, the leader of the gypsie a splendid lookingfellow who sat hi horse like a centaur waved them back andin a fierce voice gave to hi companion some word to pro ceed ,Dracula,False

8662, issue wa joined in an instant ,Dracula,False
8663,  the leader with a quick movement of hi rein threw hishorse out in front and pointed first to the sun now closedown on the hill top and then to the castle said somethingwhich i did not understand ,Dracula,False
8664, for answer all four men of ourparty threw themselve from their horse and dashed towardsthe cart ,Dracula,False
8665, i should have felt terrible fear at seeing jona than in such danger but that the ardor of battle must havebeen upon me a well a the rest of them ,Dracula,False

8668, hi men instantly formed round the cart in a sortof undisciplined endeavor each one shouldering and pushingthe other in hi eagern to carry out the order ,Dracula,False
8669,  in the midst of thi i could see that jonathan on oneside of the ring of men and quincey on the other wereforcing a way to the cart ,Dracula,False
8670, it wa evident that they werebent on finishing their task before the sun should set ,Dracula,False
8671,noth ing seemed to stop or even to hinder them ,Dracula,False
8672,neither the level led weapon nor the flashing knive of the gypsie in front nor the howling of the wolve behind appeared to evenattract their attention ,Dracula,False
